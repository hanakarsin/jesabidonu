When I was campaigning for APC in 2023, I was thinking that by now, Nigeria would have been looking like Dubai, that was what I expected,” he said.</p><p>He continued, “I least expected that the APC, my party, would not be run by a Caretaker Committee.</p><p>“In fact, I least expected that leaders of my party would agree and allow the violation of the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria by our party, the same thing we accused the previous PDP administration.</p><p>“If I deceive myself that I’m happy with what is happening, then, I’m not being honest. But let me also make this very clear, Nigerians are ridiculous people. People assumed that ‘Oh, you are talking because you’re no longer in government.</p><p>“And my answer has always been the same: is it because I’m not in government that bandits set 43 people ablaze in Sokoto; is it because I’m no longer a minister again that over 200 people were killed recently? Is it because I’m no longer a minister that 48 farmers were slaughtered one by one in Borno State?”</p><p>Dalong said though he is still a member of the APC, he doesn’t want to speculate what will happen next, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports</p><p>“There are many things that are going on in the party,” he said.</p><p>He added: “So, it is what happens in theatre that would determine my position in history. If the party proceeds the way it is and loses favour with Nigerians, I’ll stand with the Nigerian people and not follow a political party of the elites.”</p><p>Asked if accompanying Adewole on a day he declared to contest for the 2023 presidency was a clear indication that he was dumping the APC and indeed abandoning his friend, President Muhammadu Buhari, Dalong added, “I cannot abandon President Muhammadu Buhari because he is friend and father.</p><p>“He means well for the country, but I realise that good intentions alone are not enough to transform and change the country giving him the support for him to try and at least leave anything as a legacy for his tenure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49wZqJlpJ28trPHrWSnoZeav6qtjLCmrqSUYq%2Bmecuiop5llKqvorWMmp2tnaJirrGvjJusoZminnq1u86kZKiulad6sbvWnqlmnJGhvK%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
