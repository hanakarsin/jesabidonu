The 56-year-old hasn’t touched most of his public profiles since 2018, and recently his accounts were made private in wake of a new health diagnosis.</p><p>In 2021, rumors surfaced that Frank finally <a href=#>found himself a wife</a> after years of bachelorhood.

However, fans began to think that Frank's long-term relationship was headed for marriage. At the time, Frank was dating a woman named Diann, whom he occasionally posted photos of on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Facebook page</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In December 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank shared a picture</a> of Diann, her daughter Paige, and Paige’s daughter Eulalia, eliciting shocked responses from his followers when he referred to the infant as his "granddaughter."</p><p>The antiques dealer later clarified that he hadn’t gotten married, but noted, "Diann's family is my family. It is great being Grandpa Frank! I love my girls."</p><p>Sadly, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> in July 2021, Frank gave an update about his relationship as he entered rehab. "The main problem was this girlfriend I had, I thought I was getting married and I bought a brand new house. Then I found out that all the time while I was on the road, she had a boyfriend back here."</p><p>He added, “It hurt my feelings, my self-esteem and my whole world. I gave it a good shot, I tried to drink her away. I never drank that much before."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In response, Diann told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, "It's not true what he's saying. If he's trying to make me look like the bad person of course I'm going to say it's not true, because it's not." She elaborated, "I don't care to have drama or chaos in my life, I'm just trying to heal right now. It's been two years, I'm ready to move on." This implies that Diann and Frank officially broke up around 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Frank was recently hospitalized with a stroke.</h2><p>After leaving American Pickers, many fans speculated that Frank and Mike Wolfe's friendship was on the rocks.
