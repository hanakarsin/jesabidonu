Considering Zach and Tori's older two children, Jackson and Lilah, were born with achondroplasia dwarfism like their father, plenty of TLC fans have wondered: Is Josiah Roloff a little person? There have also been numerous follow-up questions about the birth itself, such as: Did Tori have a C-section? Keep reading to learn all about the newest Roloff.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Did Tori Roloff have a C-section?</h2><p>Those who have been following Tori's motherhood journey on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> know that she welcomed her first two children via C-section. But did she have a C-section with her third baby, Josiah?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@toriroloff</span></figure><p>On May 8, 2022, the mom of three took to her Instagram story to open up about her postpartum recovery. “I’ve gotten a lot of messages about how quickly I’ve bounced back,” Tori wrote, about a week after giving birth. “I’m all about keeping it real. You see the best moments on instagram. You see when we’re feeling our best.”</p><p>"Everyone kept telling me after the fact how hard C-section No. 3 is ... they're right! I don't remember pain like that," she continued. "My pain was so bad the first night home we almost called 911. Luckily, I was able to get back on track with medication after that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@toriroloff</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Is Josiah Roloff a little person?</h2><p>Because Tori did end up delivering Josiah via C-section, many fans have assumed he has achondroplasia. But does he?</p><p>Neither Zach nor Tori have shared whether Josiah is a little person. It's worth noting, however, there are other reasons a C-section would be warranted — and it doesn't necessarily confirm that Josiah has dwarfism.</p><p>Either way, Zach and Tori have likely known since about the midway point of pregnancy. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tori explained</a> when she was pregnant with Lilah that they found out she would be a dwarf because her long bones were measuring shorter and her head was measuring larger than average.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p>When she was pregnant with Josiah, Tori addressed whether they were going to find out if baby No. 3 was a little person. "I wish this could be a surprise too but when they [doctors] tell me I need a C-section, it makes it sort of obvious,” she said during an AMA session via Instagram.</p><p>Tori followed this up with: "We won't know if he or she is a dwarf until further into pregnancy. And with dwarves it's encouraged to have a C-section because of bigger head size. I was saying I'd love to not know but IF my doc says I need a C-section, it would be obvious to us."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@toriroloff</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What was Jackson Roloff's birth weight?</h2><p>Some fans have taken to comparing Josiah's birth weight to that of his older brother, Jackson, in an attempt to figure out whether the youngest Roloff is a little person. Except, this isn't an accurate indicator of dwarfism either.</p><p>At birth, Jackson Roloff (who is a dwarf) weighed in at 9 pounds, 1 ounce, and was 20.5 inches long, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> — which is actually on the bigger side for a newborn. Josiah weighed 7 pounds, 6 ounces, and was 19.5 inches long, which is a bit smaller. But again, this isn't necessarily an indicator of dwarfism.</p><p>Until the parents of three share more information, however, it's impossible to know for sure if Josiah is a little person like Zach and his older siblings, or is average-sized like Tori.</p><p>Season 23 of Little People, Big World premieres on Tuesday, May 17, at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledOoqaJloqS5sLLFZp%2BarpVirm6vjKycnKyZpLs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
