The unfortunate issue in which this generation has found itself is such that when the PDP was in governance, it thrived on social justice, fairness, equity and gave abundant room to the opposition to thrive.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation on our hands as Nigerians, in which a ruling government is harassing and stifling the opposition.</p><p>“And it is that circumstance that those who are not strong, even though they are governors, are now submitted to the harassment of APC and their imagination; that is the situation in which our party has found itself.</p><p>“A situation that is ongoing in Nigeria, unless every Nigerian rises to the occasion to stop this harassment — this luring of governors to the opposition party — we might have as a people a one-party state and that would impact negatively on our democratic culture.”</p><p>He added: “There are tendencies of making fake promises of what they can help the governors to do. There are tendencies of the aides and some commissioners of the governors being picked up by the same EFCC.</p><p>“We have a situation in our country; apart from harassing the aides and commissioners of the governors, EFCC is coming into the affairs of the PDP.</p><p>“The attempt is to muzzle the main opposition party. The attempt is to ensure that Nigeria is returned to a one-party state.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that in the last four months, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State and his Cross River counterpart, Ben Ayade, have dumped the PDP for the APC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5FrZqehl5q%2Fqq2MppiyZaOkvK95wZ6aqKWVYryvsYypmKusqWLAta3TnmSpnKBk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
