Keep reading for all the known details. Plus, stick around to find out what Susan is up to these days.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Susan Olsen up to today?</h2><p>Following her star-turning performance in The Brady Bunch, the actress landed many other roles in productions like Pacific Blue, <a href=#>The Young and the Restless</a>, and the Lifetime movie Blending Christmas. She's since slowed down her Hollywood ventures to pursue radio, hosting Two Chicks Talkin' Politics on LA Talk Radio.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> reported that Susan was fired from her hosting gig for going on a homophobic rant on the air. Three years later, she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> she was "the subject of fake news" and "never got fired."</p><p>Susan has joined the other surviving Brady Bunch cast members for many events, including the 2019 television series A Very Brady Renovation and the <a href=#>74th Primetime Emmy Awards</a>. In 2023, the child actor appeared at The Hollywood Museum and set the record straight about the rumored affair between her TV mother and brother.</p><p>"I disliked the rumors that Florence Henderson and Barry Williams had an affair," she said via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>. "Barry had a crush on her. She was very kind to him. She let him take her out for her birthday."</p><p>Susan added, "I don't like the implication that's been out there, that something was going on with them. There wasn't anything going on with them except for mutual respect and love."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Susan also addressed rumors about her death, stating, "That's pretty much a fabrication. There actually was a young girl named Susan Olsen who got her coat stuck in the door of a bus, and was dragged several blocks, and died. And some news source on the East Coast reported that it was me."</p><p>"And there were always rumors that I was dead," she continued. "It made me feel like Paul McCartney because it was at the same time that there were rumors that Paul McCartney was dead."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMK0rc1mpqWrlaN6tbvDmrBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
