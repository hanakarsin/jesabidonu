Being able to take a look back at how we consumed music over the past 12 months has been a cherished tradition among Spotify users ever since it started in 2016. Pretty much everyone loves sharing their own lists with their friends and family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of the coolest features that Spotify Wrapped affords users is being able to see where they rank compared to other listeners of the same artist, manifesting in a top percent figure shown in Wrapped to the chosen few who are truly devoted to that person's music. So, what does that top percent figure actually mean?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What exactly does top percent mean on Spotify Wrapped?</h2><p>The title "top percent" reflects that a user is in an artist's top listening base, essentially meaning they listen to their music more than the average listener.</p><p>The way that Spotify calculates if you're in an artist's top percent hasn't ever really been fully disclosed, but it's safe to assume that the app takes into account a variety of factors when judging, including both total time spent listening and the number of songs played.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The data is collected from Jan.1 to "a few weeks before launch," per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify FAQ page</a>.
