We've met his <a href=#>parents</a> before (dad Chapman is a retired firefighter, and mom Megan is a teacher) — and we also know <a href=#>his uncle Patrick Warburton</a> happens to be a Seinfeld legend. (When Patrick appeared on The Bachelorette last season for Zach's hometown date with Rachel, it was a treasure.) But who are Zach's siblings?</p><p style=text-align:start>Zach has two younger sisters: Samantha and Payton.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: LinkedIn/Samantha Shallcross</a><p>Payton, Samantha, and Zach Shallcross</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, Samantha currently works as a customer success manager at Wellable, an employee wellness company. She got her bachelor's degree in public health from California State University, Fullerton, in 2021.</p><p>Payton, meanwhile, is currently a student, per her own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> page. In fact, it looks like she decided to follow her big brother's footsteps at California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo. Zach got his bachelor's degree in business administration from the school in 2019.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: LinkedIn/Samantha Shallcross; LinkedIn/Payton Shallcross</a><p>Samantha and Payton Shallcross</p></figure><p>And it looks like Zach's fam is rooting for his Bachelor success like all the rest of us. Ahead of his season premiere, Samantha wrote a sweet message on LinkedIn to wish her big brother luck.</p><p>"Happy Bachelor Monday!" she wrote. "To anybody that watches or is interested in watching I highly recommend tuning in and watching this season of The Bachelor. My brother Zach Shallcross is an amazing human who absolutely deserves the world. I can’t wait to see what is to come, you will always have my love and support."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook/Megan Warburton Shallcross</a><p>Zach being an adorbs big brother to his little sisters in 2009</p></figure><p>Zach recently talked to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanford Daily</a> and said he had a watch party with family and friends for his season's premiere episode. When asked about what his fam thinks of his being a TV star now, he said: "I still don’t think my dad knows what the hell the show is, to be honest.</p><p>"My mom is very excited. She’s been a fan for years, and she’s so loving and supportive through it all; that’s the great part. My sisters used to be really big fans of the show, but now they don’t want to watch their brother being in a hot tub with other women."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfr66ktIysn5qknJi%2FsL%2FSZqqimpyeu6i%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
