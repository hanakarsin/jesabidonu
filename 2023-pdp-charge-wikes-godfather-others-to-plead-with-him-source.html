David Mark and Bukola Saraki; the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of PDP, Sen. Walid Jibril, ex-governors and current governors especially Samuel Ortom and Seyi Makinde.</p><p>The source that spoke on the issue said, “PDP is jittery about losing Wike and the South-South because with Peter Obi’s pervasiveness in Labour Party, the South-East is no longer a robust political base for it.</p><p>“The main opposition party is also on the edge in the Northeast with the choice of Sen. Kashim Shettima as the vice-presidential candidate of APC. Also, the Southwest is a dead-end for PDP. And the APC Muslim – Muslim ticket appeals to the North-West.</p><p>“The only option left for PDP is reconciliation. This is why PDP leaders have become jittery and desperate to open fresh talks with Wike.</p><p>“Key leaders leading engagement with Wike are ex-governor Peter Odili, two former Presidents of the Senate, Sen. David Mark and Bukola Saraki; the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of PDP, Sen. Walid Jibril, ex-governors and some founding fathers of PDP.</p><p>“The way APC has capitalised on differences in PDP was a wake-up call to the opposition party to accommodate every interest.</p><p>“This party is ready to assuage not only Wike but all those with grudges.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BsZmtoYmh6sbDPZpqhmaKcsm7DyKScrGWXpLGnrdOhnKtln6m1pr7SZquoZaChsqKwjLCgraBdnbauedKorKublWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
