And with 50 seasons under its belt, the show continues to get better with time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since the show is filmed in a large kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances, it’s easy to believe that shooting takes place at a studio. And while the show is clearly filmed in a studio, its location may come as a surprise to viewers. So, where is Chopped filmed? Keep reading to get the full scoop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is ‘Chopped’ filmed?</h2><p>It makes sense that a show of Chopped’s magnitude would be filmed in a big city! According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mashed</a>, the series is filmed in New York City at Food Network’ studios, located in Chelsea Market.</p><p>Additionally, Chopped champion <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef Silvia Baldini</a> told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a> in 2018 that filming also takes place outside of the studio at the contestants' homes.</p><p>“For a couple of months before the actual episode made, a crew films the chefs at their home and in their kitchens for the bios and extras," she told the publication. “And special episodes add even more twists to the filming schedule.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Silvia went on to share that filming an episode of the show only takes one day to complete.</p><p>“The actual episode takes a day,” Silvia shared. “You meet the other chefs at 4 in the morning at the studios in Chelsea, and then you get in your chopped gear and you film.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Food Network site also features an "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">insider's tou</a>r" of the Chopped set, including photos of the cooking spaces, the pantry, and the fridge.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The ‘Chopped’ application process is a bit on the lengthy side.</h2><p>It’s no secret that chefs have to go through a standard audition process to be considered for Chopped. For starters, prospective chefs will have to fill out a questionnaire and send in photos of themselves.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mashed shares that if these chefs are able to make it to the next round, they're required to do a video interview with producers as they ask personal questions. During this time, producers are looking for an angle or potential backstory for the show. (After all, a good backstory can garner sympathy from viewers.) And of course, there are more rounds to go through.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Silvia mentioned to Cheat Sheet that applicants have to submit a preliminary video as well. She noted that there are multiple rounds of casting that prospective chefs have to endure before getting the green light.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of course, there are legal parameters hopeful chefs have to agree to before earning a coveted spot on the show. Mashed shares that there are nondisclosure agreements in place, and if they are violated, chefs can be subjected to a lawsuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlk528sbzEnWSfoZyisqU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
