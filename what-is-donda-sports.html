"Donda Spots also encompasses athlete representation [and is] a full serviced sports brand including apparel, sneakers, and much more."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who owns Donda Sports?</h2><p>As most of us know, the name Donda has a special meaning to one particular celebrity: <a href=#>Kanye "Ye" West</a>.</p><p>For those unaware, this was his late mother's name, <a href=#>the title of his 10th studio album</a>, and has been the name of his creative content company since 2012.

"This is for the people who counted us out, for everyone who said we can‚Äôt ‚Äî we say we will."</p><p>"As president, it was important to me to book the Donda Suite for this year's SUPER BOWL LVI.
