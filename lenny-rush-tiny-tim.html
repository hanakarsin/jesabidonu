The mini-series â€” also titled A Christmas Carol â€” tells the classic story in three parts, and although I haven't sat down and watched it yet, I can already tell it's going to be a tear-jerker.</p><p>One of the greatest parts about FX's remake â€” however â€” is undoubtedly the young actor who plays Tiny Tim. His name is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenny Rush</a>, and let me tell you, he's a really big deal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's what you need to know about Lenny Rush, the actor who plays Tiny Tim.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Like the characters in A Christmas Story, Lenny is also British.&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenny Rush</a> is a 10-year-old actor from Essex, which is a southern county in the United Kingdom. He was born and raised there, so yes, the accent in the show is â€” in fact â€”&nbsp;his real accent. Exciting!</p><p>When Lenny isn't busy acting in a movie or play, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he attends Burnham-On-Crouch Primary School</a>, according to Echo News. On weekends, he takes acting lessons in comedy, drama, musical theatre, film, and television at Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts (PQA), which is based in Wickford.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>22nd 23rd & 24th Dec 9pm BBC 1/FX https://instagram.com/p/B5_Xo_Oh2Pw/</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Lenny Rush</a> (@mrlennyrush) on Dec 12, 2019 at 11:22pm PST</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Although he's quite young, Lenny has had a decent amount of acting experience.&nbsp;</h2><p>It turns out Lenny started acting long before he landed a role in this brand new FX series. In fact, according to the FX website, he's currently working on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBeebies series, Apple Tree House, </a>playing the role of Eli, and has been nominated for a BAFTA Children's Award for working on the series My Family.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, this isn't even young Lenny's first time working on a production of A Christmas Carol â€” according to his IMDB page, he appeared in Jack Thorne's stage adaptation of A Christmas Carol, directed by Matthew Warchurs, at the highly prestigious Old Vic Theatre in London. It goes without saying Lenny has had major acting experience, and he's only about to skyrocket in the British acting scene.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Cracking on with rehearsals with these lovely people! ðŸŽ­#lifeofanactor#beyourselfbeamazing Posted @withrepost â€¢ @oldvictheatre 'Christmas is to be shared.

It largely affects bone growth, and although it can be debilitating at times, he doesn't let it get him down. &nbsp;</p><p>While several productions of the film have been hesitant about casting someone with disabilities as Tiny Tim, Lenny is thrilled to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the opportunity to represent the character</a>. He told Daily Mail:</p><p>"I&nbsp;think why not cast a disabled actor in the role of a disabled person if they are good at what they do?
