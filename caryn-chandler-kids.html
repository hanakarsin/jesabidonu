Although it's not clear when, exactly, Matt started dating former Roloff Farms manager <a href=#>Caryn Chandler</a>, fans have speculated that things were romantic between them before he officially split from Amy — making viewers' feelings toward Caryn even more complicated.</p><p>As they have gotten to know Matt's girlfriend more through the years, via the <a href=#>TLC</a> series and social media, they've wondered about Caryn's kids.

"As we continue to get closer and plan a future together, it's really important to me for you to have a relationship with them and I know they would like that as well."</p><p>Matt added, "Back when Brittany and Conor were young they used to come and help out during pumpkin season.

In 2016 and 2017 he was arrested for theft, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Sun</a>.</p><p>Although he revealed in 2018 via Facebook that he was sober, unfortunately, his legal troubles didn't end there.</p><p>On Jan. 11, 2020, Connor was arrested and charged on two counts of harassment against Caryn, to which he pleaded not guilty. He “did unlawfully and intentionally harass or annoy” his mother by subjecting her to “offensive physical contact,” according to court papers, per The Sun. As a condition of his release, Connor was ordered to have no contact with Caryn and her family and not to go within 100 feet of her.</p><p>In May 2020, he was hit with two additional charges of "attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon" and "did unlawfully and intentionally damage property, the property of Caryn Chandler," to which he also pleaded not guilty, per the outlet.</p><p>In August 2020, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear at his settlement conference; he was arrested on Aug. 28 and released the same day. When he missed his Nov. 23, 2020, court hearing for a status check, a warrant was issued for Connor's arrest. He turned himself in on Nov. 30.</p><p>Though Connor had eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief, the other three charges were dropped.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Famous Room/YouTube</span></figure><p>After Connor revealed in April 2021 that he and his girlfriend Ashley were expecting a baby, it appeared Connor was on good terms with his mother, as Caryn helped throw a gender reveal party.</p><p>Connor and Ashley welcomed baby boy Liam that August.
