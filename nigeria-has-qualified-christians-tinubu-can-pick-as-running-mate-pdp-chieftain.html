In as much as we have qualified Muslims, we also, have qualified Christians. What stopped him from selecting from among available Christians?” Aliyu asked during the interview with Daily Post.</p><p>According to him, once Tinubu succeeded in his ambition and plans, Christianity would be forgotten in the country because they will have no say at the national level.</p><p>Aliyu stressed that the Christians have suffered a lot in some states that have Muslim-Muslim governorship tickets, adding that Christians have the highest attack and the highest number of sacked workers from state government ministries and parastatals.</p><p>He said it is clear that some elements in Nigeria want to do away with Christianity when it comes to Federal Government appointments into major positions.</p><p>“I am so surprised as this country is turned into ‘my religion is more than your own”, as such, you have no say in anything,” he lamented.</p><p>The PDP chieftain stressed that our past leaders; Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, and Sir Ahmadu Bello, see all Nigerians as brothers and sisters, adding that their cooperation as one entity led to the growth of Nigeria until bad elements and criminals eroded our values.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BqZqehl5q%2Fqq2MoZisZaGqrq21xaKcnWWTnb%2Bqv9OimKerXam2r8HBrmScmZ5ivaqvymaYrGWiqruvtc2gZKaZpJp6sbDPZpqhoZWbwaK1zWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
