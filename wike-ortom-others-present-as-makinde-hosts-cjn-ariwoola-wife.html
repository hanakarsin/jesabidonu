We have my Lords from different states and geopolitical zones of this country.</p><p>“This is a turning point. For the first time in the history of Oyo state, we have produced the number five citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. So, old things have passed away and things have become new.”</p><p>In his remarks, CJN Ariwoola promised not to let Nigerians down, adding that it is during Makinde’s time that the Yoruba has the position of the number five citizen.</p><p>He also called on politicians to allow the judiciary to perform its function while warning the judiciary to leave politics for politicians.</p><p>He said: “On October 12, when I was sworn in as the CJN in a substantive capacity, the governor appreciated President Muhammadu Buhari on behalf of the entire Oyo state and the president just smiled, but maybe he did not understand.</p><p>“The Lord single-handedly, as He has always done, did it for my governor. It is during his time that the Yoruba has the position of the CJN again, which it last had 37 years ago.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JqZrChm5p6sL7TqKRmp6SdsrO%2FjKmpnquVo8FurdJmpJqjmaOxpnnHqKqtq12Yt695wKugsKefoa5uw8ifnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
