But so are stories about love, high-level politics, and unstoppable killing machines stalking 20-something-year-olds.</p><p><a href=#>Jeff Bridges'</a> The Old Man takes this tried-and-true formula to a new FX series and is based off of a popular 2017 novel of the same name.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what's the story behind Jeff Bridges' 'The Old Man'?</h2><p>Bridges plays Chase (his name will make sense in a second) who is out on the lam after a thwarted assassination attempt compromises his off-the-grid lifestyle.</p><p>Why was he living in solitude and trying to stay away from society as much as possible? Well, it's because he's a CIA operative. At least, he was until he decided to jump ship and get out of the business of espionage, destabilizing governments, and doing a whole bunch of killing in the process.</p><p>But as the saying goes, old habits die hard, and Chase must do his best to avoid getting captured while trying to ensure he can stay lost for good. Of course, it's not like whoever's hunting him down will let that happen easily. But while he's on the run, Chase, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> puts it, "learns that to ensure his future he now must reconcile his past."</p><p>Which probably means that he's taking the fight to whoever is stalking him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube | @Movie Trailers Source</span></figure><p>In the series, Chase is being hunted down by FBI assistant director Harold Harper (John Lithgow), who is very familiar with the former operative. Joining the actor is Alia Shawkat, who plays Harper's right hand, along with E.J. Bonilla as CIA Special Agent Raymond Waters.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The trailer for 'The Old Man' teases a ton of action.</h2><p>Watching the clip, viewers can gather a few things.</p><p>One: He travels with two Rottweilers.</p><p>Two: There's a woman whom he trusts enough to confide in — something we learn right from the get-go when he calls her while on the run: "Remember that I love ya, I'll always love ya," he says on the phone.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>We also see that he's got a "bug-out bag" of sorts, complete with money and firepower, and he hops on a plane with Amy Brenneman's character (Zoe), who absconds with him while he's on the run.</p><p>In the trailer we see him stab, smash, shoot, and choke his way out of a variety of different scenarios.</p><p>He also references having a "kid" in the trailer and says that if anyone messes with them, he's going to send those who do "back in pieces."</p><p>The trailer closes out with Chase saying that the best things in his life were attained whenever he worked in the service of defending someone or something.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aim for a legend and pray you don't miss.

His suggestion is simple but effective: "learn to be a better writer."</p><p>The premise of the novel is alive and well in the series judging from its official synopsis and trailer, but we'll have to wait until it airs to see how it's been adapted to fit the screen.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeff Bridges is laughing about his mano a mano fight scenes in his new FX series, The old Man.
