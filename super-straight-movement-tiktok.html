Since … I get called transphobic because I wouldn’t date a trans woman.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The TikTok user claimed he couldn’t be transphobic because that’s just his “sexuality.”</h2><p>Kyle then relayed a conversation he’d have with those who’d call him transphobic: “You know, they’re like, ‘Would you date a trans woman?’ ‘No.’ ‘Why? That’s a female.’ ‘Uh, no, like, that’s not a real woman to me. Like, I want a real woman.’ ‘No, you’re just transphobic.’”</p><p>He went on: “So now, I’m super straight. I only date the opposite gender — women — that are born women. So, you can’t say I’m transphobic now because that’s just my sexuality, you know?”</p><p>(Fact check: Sexuality does not preclude transphobia or other gender-based biases.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kyle says he has been banned on TikTok.</h2><p>In his TikTok bio, Kyle says he’s banned on the platform, and he directs followers to his Instagram account and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe campaign</a> of his.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else super straight?

Versus, ‘I won’t date you because you’re black,’ which means that she thinks there’s something inherently wrong with Black people, even if she doesn’t consciously think so. The exact same thing applies to what you’re saying.”</p><p>The TikTok user continued: “Also, I think it’s really funny that you think you’re super straight. You like women, but you’re excluding an entire group of women. If a plumber only works on shower drains and refuses to work on sinks, we don’t call him a ‘super plumber.’ If anything, you’re semi-straight, or straight-impaired. ‘Huh. Maybe I should reexamine my prejudice.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Twitter users are also calling out the “super straight” movement.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I better not catch any of my mutuals unironically using <a href=#>#superstraight</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fOnILNrED2</a></p>— Spike ❤️ (@2ndartbook) <a href=#>March 6, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The so-called “Super Straight Revolution” is going over like a lead balloon on Twitter, too.
