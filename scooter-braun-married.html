It's hard not to filter them through his <a href=#>public feud with Taylor Swift</a>. Saying, "If you really love someone, you push them" outside the confines of his former control over the songstress sounds tough but fair. However, thinking about it in terms of a person who was once holding Taylor's music hostage now gives it an aggressive slant.</p><p>In June 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scooter announced via Instagram</a> that he was retiring from the music management business after 23 years of questionable service. In the post he mentioned some hits his personal life took, which was undoubtedly referencing his marriage to Canadian health activist Yael Cohen Braun. Is Scooter Braun married? Here's what we know about the oft-difficult personal life of the now retired artist manager.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Scooter Braun married?</h2><p>In July 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a> reported that Scooter and his wife, Yael Cohen Braun, were separating after seven years of marriage. This was a far cry from a conversation the former couple had in October 2014 for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Company</a>, where Scooter said he "married the best woman," and added that he "won the lottery." A pregnant Yael giggled and put her hand on his knee then turned the conversation towards teamwork, stating that they could do anything together. Sadly, that turned out not to be the case.</p><p>A source told PEOPLE that "their friendship is the best it's ever been, but they're taking some time apart to sort things out." This person also claimed the COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to the demise of their relationship, suggesting the intense time together drove the Brauns apart. There were also unsubstantiated rumors that Scooter could have stepped out of his marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@yael</a></figure><p>What we do know for sure is that in the months leading up to their separation, Scooter was living through some very dark times. So much so, that he checked himself into the Hoffman Process program which is a "week-long residential and personal growth retreat that helps participants identify negative behaviors, moods, and ways of thinking that developed unconsciously and were conditioned in childhood," per their website.</p><p>Scooter went into detail about his stay while guesting on Jay Shetty's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Purpose</a> podcast stating that he was "feeling like I wasn’t present in my life, and [feeling] like the people around me who loved me, I felt their hurt." As he began to sink deeper and deeper into despair, Scooter said he began telling himself he wasn't enough and was asking what he was doing here.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a>, the couple finalized their divorce in September 2022. Yael got a heft divorce settlement which included staying in their $30 million Brentwood home, keeping a 2021 Land Rover Defender, and several pieces of art. Scooter also has to pay $60,000 a month in child support for their three children on top of the big check he wrote her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>Ein Beitrag geteilt von Scott “Scooter” Braun (@scooterbraun)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Yael Cohen Braun's net worth? Probably enough to raise their kids!</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Yael is worth $100 million, which undoubtedly includes the $20 million she got from Scooter in the divorce. Before the couple met, Yael started the nonprofit organization F--k Cancer in 2009 after her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">company's website</a>. As of the time of this writing, the nonprofit "runs programs and events focusing on prevention, early detection, and supporting those affected by cancer."</p><p>As previously stated, Yael gets a fairly impressive chunk of change every month for the three children she and Scooter share. In October 2022 she spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> about what life was like post-divorce. "Obviously, it's a new landscape," she said. "Everyone is figuring it out but with love, grace and respect. That's all you can hope for." Their children, Jagger, 9, Levi, 8, and Hart, 5, remain largely out of the public eye apart from appearances on their parents' social media accounts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLCwu9OeqWaaopbCr3nMmqmroZWZ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
