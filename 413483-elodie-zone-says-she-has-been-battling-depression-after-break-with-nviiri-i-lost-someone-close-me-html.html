I made this when I wasn’t in the right state of mind then went back and forth trying to decide if I should post it or not. I’ve finally decided to because I feel like sometimes I make everything in my life seem perfect online when in reality I’m just as human as you. I get sad, a lot," the YouTuber wrote in part.<p class=align-left>She went ahead to narrate how she has been struggling with depression since she was 14, thanking her fans for being supportive.</p>"I struggle with my mental health, a lot. Truthfully, I have no idea what I’m even doing half the time... but all of you that follow and support me are the reason I keep going. I feel like I’m not fighting for myself, but for this huge family online that may not have anyone else who’s fighting for them. I’ve been extremely open about my struggle with depression since I was 14, so for anyone going through the same- I love you," she said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/31cb1880bd5e52fe.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Former Women Rep Joyce Lay Declares She'll Never Return to Politics: "I'm Not Looking Back"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Elodie has been using her social accounts to talk about mental health, trying to help many who are not doing well, but she has taken a break from doing that.</p>"The racing thoughts, the need to blame yourself, the physical chest pains, the numbness. We’re in this together because there’s no other way out than through supporting each other. I took a pause from Mental Mondays cause I felt like I was lying telling you to “be okay” when I was far from it. I’ll be more open about my situation in the next episode," she concluded.<p class=align-left>In October 2020, Nviiri and Elodie Zone were spotted together several times getting cosy, and before they spoke out, the cat was already out of the bag.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking in an interview with <strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong>, Nviiri said he never knew he would <a href=#>date someone in the limelight and wanted his relationship to be private</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6fd3d7db8e4c2d97.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Woman Forced To Painfully Inform 6-Year-Old Son She Has Stage 3 Cancer, Will Soon Die</span></p></a>"We have been friends for eight years. We kept our relationship a secret for months without telling people we were dating. We needed to understand ourselves, are we strong enough for the public because they can be ruthless," Nviiri said.<p class=align-left>He added:</p>"Our decision was to keep it low until we were ready to announce it. It affects our brands in a way...will I still continue being Nviiri the ladies' man, bwana pombe sigara, single man? Dynamics change. And for her, will she continue being the same role model? By the time people came to find about it, we were already confident about our relationship." \<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
