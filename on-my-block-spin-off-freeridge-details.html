Details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>As viewers mourn the conclusion of <a href=#>On My Block</a> after three years, <a href=#>four season</a>s, and an epic two-year time jump in the plot, Netflix has revealed that fans will get to see more from the Freeridge neighborhood with a spin-off series.</p><p>The news of the upcoming Netflix production, which is aptly named Freeridge, may temporarily fill the void for those who are already missing <a href=#>On My Block</a>, but what other details are known about the series?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Netflix has ordered 'Freeridge,' an 'On My Block' spin-off series — all the details thus far.</h2><p>Just days before Season 4 of On My Block debuted, Netflix confirmed that a spin-off show called Freeridge was in the works. Like On My Block, Freeridge will take place in the same South Central L.A. neighborhood, and it will follow a group of close friends.</p><p>Unlike its predecessor, which centered around two male friends and three female friends (once Jasmine Flores became a regular character), Freeridge will feature an all-female crew of teens during their high school years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Other information about casting and the characters has yet to be shared. Unfortunately for fans of the original series, it does not appear at this time like any of the On My Block personalities will be included in the spin-off.</p><p>Netflix seemingly confirmed that the original characters would not be part of the new show (which makes sense considering where viewers leave most of them in the series finale).</p><p>"...We'll be saying goodbye to Monse, Ruby, Jamal, Cesar, and Jasmine," a Sept. 27<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> tweet</a> from Netflix read. "We won't be leaving this incredible universe just yet. Thrilled to announce the stories will continue in Freeridge, an On My Block spinoff!"</p><p>On My Block co-creators Lauren Iungerich, Jeremy Haft, and Eddie Gonzalez will work alongside new additions Jamie Dooner and Jamie Uyeshiro on the new show.</p><p>"Some of the greatest comments we've heard about On My Block were from fans telling us that they felt seen and represented," Jeremy, Jamie, and Eddie said in a statement about the new show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. "As we embark on Freeridge, a more female-driven show, we will continue to invest in authentic characters that represent our passionate audience... Oh, and there may be gnomies."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Tracey Pakosta, the head of comedy for Netflix, also shared a statement about the upcoming show — but it did not reveal many other details.</p><p>"While this chapter is closing for our OG squad this October as they reach the end of High School, we are excited to bring a brand new cast of characters and stories to life in this On my Block spin-off," she said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. "There are so many more stories to tell in Freeridge, and we're grateful to continue this journey with Lauren, Eddie, Jeremy, Jamie Uyeshiro and Jamie Dooner."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has Netflix announced a release date for 'Freeridge'?</h2><p>The streamer has yet to share when fans can expect to see Freeridge on their screens. While many are hopeful that the show will debut at some point in 2022, it is unclear at this time when Season 1 will be released.</p><p>Until then, Netflix subscribers can watch and rewatch On My Block.</p><p>All four seasons are available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLtuudhmmaWnk6B6tLzIp2SonpZis7OxxKugnZ%2BVYrGmwMCio6w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
