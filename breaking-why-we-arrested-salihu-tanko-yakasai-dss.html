He is being investigated over issues beyond the expression of opinions in the social media as wrongly alleged by sections of the public,” the DSS statement noted.</p><p>It will be recalled as earlier reported by <strong>Naija News</strong> that Yakasai, was <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>arrested by the Department of State Services</a></strong> in Kano on Friday.</p><p>He was arrested after he called on <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> to address the activities of bandits in the country or resign.</p><p>Tanko-Yakasai stated this on Friday while reacting to the abduction of schoolgirls at Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in Talata Mafara Local Government Area of Zamfara State.</p><p>He noted that the government has failed in its responsibilities following the abduction of students in Nigerian schools.</p><p>Tanko-Yakasai further stated that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has failed Nigerians.</p><p>He wrote on Twitter: “Clearly, we as APC government, at all levels, have failed Nigerians in the number 1 duty we were elected to do which is to secure lives & properties. Not a single day goes by without some insecurity in this land. This is a shame! Deal with terrorists decisively or resign.”</p><p>“Each time another tragedy happens, we lament, condemn, create a hashtag, the govt pretends to do something, no concrete steps to prevent reoccurrence, and then we repeat the process. To what end? Where are those saddled with the responsibility?”</p><p>“Just last week, it was #freekagaraboys, today we have a new hashtag, #RescueJangebeGirls; who knows tomorrow what hashtag we will come up with? Perhaps one for ourselves when we get caught up in one of these daring attacks. This is sad & heartbreaking; I feel helpless & hopeless.”</p><p>His father, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai also <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed the arrest of his son by the DSS</a></strong> but noted that he wasn’t sure if he has been moved out of Kano or not.</p><p>The older Yakasai had disclosed that his son was arrested on his way to the barbing saloon.</p><p>Shortly after the arrest, the&nbsp;Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>fired Salihu Tanko Yakasai as his media adviser</a></strong> after criticizing the government of President Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p>A statement from Information Commissioner <strong>Mohammed Garba</strong> said the governor had taken the action because of his “indecent remarks”.</p><p>“He (Salihu) failed to distinguish between his own views and the views of the government on public issues, so he will not be allowed to continue working with a government that he does not support.” The statement quoted Mohammed Garba as saying.</p><p>He added that the dismissal took effect immediately.</p><p>This is the second time Ganduje has taken the step of firing on his special assistant. He was suspended last year after criticizing Buhari for refusing to address the nation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FwZpuqlZa4qrrGZq6hsV2ssm6t0aucrKyVmXq0rcuin65lpJa7rLuMspikmaOWtm6w0qxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
