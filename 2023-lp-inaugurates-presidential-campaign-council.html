It is very costly. Our slogan is that we don’t give ‘shishi’, but this time around, we have to look for money.</p><p>“Nigerians have realised they need to take back the country. The massive support and followership enjoyed in recent times show the people are ready and determined to take back their country.</p><p>“We need a lot of funding to drive the process. The presidential candidate cannot fund the campaigns alone; he does not have the money. The greatest challenge that we are likely to have in this campaign is funding.</p><p>“Our presidential candidate was a governor in Anambra. He is the only governor known not to have embezzled money. He kept N75 billion in the account of Anambra state and he is the only governor not on pension.</p><p>“The point I am making is that he cannot fund the presidential campaigns alone. Therefore, all of us in this council have the responsibility to join hands with the party to see how we can raise funds for this campaign.”</p><p>Recall that Obi had in October <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>unveiled a website for the donation</a></strong> of funds for the party’s campaign and keep tabs on the party’s activities of the party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FyZmtoYmh6rbyMoqWarZeqv6LAxKxkqaqVqLalsc2toJqkXZiurrzAop6nZZOkwq%2BvyKVm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
