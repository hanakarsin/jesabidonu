Could she be playing an assistant or student of Madame Web's?</p><p>In the Marvel comics, Madame Web (aka Cassandra Webb) was actually Spider-Man's ally, aiding him with the use of her clairvoyant powers, per a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerdist</a> report. How did Madame Web get her name? She was born blind and with a neuromuscular condition that made it challenging for her to move and breathe.</p><p>As a result, she got her own life support system, which happened to look like a spider-web — hence her Marvel moniker.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sydney Sweeney (@sydney_sweeney)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bring on the fan theories about Sydney's 'Madame Web' character!</h2><p>Is Madame Web even a superhero movie if there aren't a whole plethora of fan theories about who the cast is playing? Noted Marvel content creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@thejstoobs</a> has a theory about Sydney's Madame Web character that feels pretty exciting as a prospect.</p><p>She explained her theory on her Twitter page, writing, "If Sydney Sweeney is playing Ghost Spider Gwen Stacy that would be the universe where Peter dies & she gets bitten instead. Meaning Sony’s villain verse would finally have a spider person to bring everything together. Just a thought."</p><p>The character of Ghost Spider Gwen Stacy did appear in Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse. She also appeared in the trailer for the sequel (note: Sydney Sweeney did not voice Ghost Spider Gwen Stacy).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jstoobs href=#>@jstoobs</a><p>I’m here for a spider gwen solo series <a title=spiderman href=#>#spiderman</a> <a title=spidergwen href=#>#spidergwen</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - jay" href=#>♬ original sound - jay</a></figure><p>Per another report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JoBlo</a>, another popular fan theory is that Sydney will play Black Cat. In the Marvel comics, Black Cat was many things to Spider-Man. Sometimes she was an ally, other times a love-interest, and occasionally, she was Spider-Man's enemy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The 'Madame Web' movie is scheduled to premiere in the fall of 2023.</h2><p>Sony recently pushed back the release date for Madame Web to October 6, 2023. The film was previously scheduled to premiere in theaters in the summer of 2023. The upcoming spin-off of the primary Spider-Man franchise is one of Sony's most highly anticipated live-action Marvel superhero films coming up. The Dakota Johnson-led film will be directed by S.J. Clarkson, who previously directed episodes of the Netflix Marvel series Jessica Jones and The Defenders.</p><p>For now, until more details are revealed, who do you think Sydney might be playing in Madame Web?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMalusSyZKyvlZq7psWMppidmZ2aerixwQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
