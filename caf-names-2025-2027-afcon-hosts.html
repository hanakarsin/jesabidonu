They believe that Morocco would use the 2025 edition of AFCON to further prove to the world that they can co-host the 2030 World Cup.</p><p>Two years after the 2025 edition of AFCON, the prestigious football competition will be jointly hosted in Eastern Africa by three countries, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.</p><p>After announcing the hosts for the 2025 and 2027 AFCON, CAF president, Patrice Motsepe said, “The decision that was taken today was to focus on African unity, development and growth, in the context of those countries withdrawing.</p><p>“A huge amount of money is being spent on Morocco for 2025. The bid from Morocco to host the World Cup is not just for Morocco, but for the whole of Africa.”</p><p>Note that the next edition of the tournament (2023 AFCON), will be hosted in Ivory Coast from 13 January until 11 February 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5FwZpyZlmK7ornErGRraGJqenN8kXBkmp6TpLtutM6sq6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
