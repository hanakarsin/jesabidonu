"They are very private," added the source.</p><p>Back then, it sounded like Jill was absolutely taken by Hannah's Nanette, saying she "was so blown away" at a roundtable discussion she did with the comedian.</p><p>"We had breakfast the next morning ... and we became friends after that," she said according to Page Six. "We realized yes, we both have a lot of things in common that we like to talk about that generally annoy other people."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ali Goldstein/ NETFLIX © 2020</span></figure><p>"I think it overwhelms people," Hannah added. "It was nice to meet someone who in the course of a small talk, you are talking about consent." At the time of Page Six's reporting, it sounded like things were getting serious between the two, as one source said that "Jill recently went to Australia to meet Hannah's family."</p><p>Flash forward two years, and we have to assume that the relationship did not stick, as they are conspicuously absent from each other's social media. Does that mean Hannah is single these days? We hope to learn more about her private life when Douglas premieres.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is 'Douglas' about?</h2><p>From the looks of the Douglas trailer, it seems like Hannah wasn't quite expecting the resounding praise she'd get for Nanette, and now has a tough act to follow.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Safe to say I did not quit.

"Had I known just how wildly popular trauma was going to be in the context of comedy, I might have budgeted my s--t a bit better."</p><p>"But I went and put all my trauma eggs into one basket like a f--king idiot and now here we are," she jokes.</p><p>Now, she's here to talk about her dog! Well, kind of. According to the official Netflix press release, Douglas "is a grand tour of guffaw that takes you from the dog park to the High Renaissance and back into an unnamed box."&nbsp;</p><p>We have no doubt that the Emmy and Peabody-award winning comedian has a sophisticated show full of ups and downs in store for us. "Expect your expectations to be set and then met in the most unexpected ways," the release continues, with a final emphatic "Woof."</p><p>Hannah Gadsby: Douglas premieres May 26 on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6vusChZKCZlKivunnPmqmtppWnerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
