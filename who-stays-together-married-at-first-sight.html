This season of the Lifetime reality series had more than its fair share of drama and storylines, from <a href=#>Iris' virginity</a> to <a href=#>Matt's cheating</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, at the end of the day, it looks like two couples have decided to stick it out and try to make their marriages work without the reality TV cameras.
