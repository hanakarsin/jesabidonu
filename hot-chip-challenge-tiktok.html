The "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Chip Challenge</a>," also known as the '"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Chip Challenge</a>," is currently heating things up on the platform. If you're a brave soul who wants to put their spice tolerance to the test, we've got all the challenge deets. Or if you're a weakling like myself (I'm already sweating!) and just want to watch some epic reaction videos, we've got those, too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the "One Chip Challenge" (aka the "Hot Chip Challenge")?</h2><p>Tortilla chip brand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paqu</a>i is the mastermind behind the "One Chip Challenge," which also goes by "Hot Chip Challenge" on TikTok. The snack manufacturer, which uses real peppers in its products, has always been known for its tangy and zesty chips. But in 2016, it decided to take things up a notch and used Carolina Reaper peppers to create the world's hottest chip. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PepperHead</a>, the Carolina Reaper pepper is the hottest pepper in the world.</p><p>Because of the pepper's extreme zest, the brand challenged folks to try the new chip and share their reactions on social media with the hashtag #OneChipChallenge. Fortunately, it was a hit and Paqui decided to make it a yearly thing by releasing an annual zesty chip. Over the years, most challengers have just attempted to see how long they can go post‚Äìchip consumption before reaching for a beverage. However, others have upped the ante by trying to consume multiple challenge chips.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Each individually wrapped chip comes packaged in a coffin-shaped box for, well, obvious reasons. "This year‚Äôs chip is all thriller, no filler with two totally terrifying peppers: the infamous Carolina Reaper and the stinging Scorpion Pepper. Are you ready to face the Reaper?" Paqui wrote on its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> of its 2021 chip.</p><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@princeoffitness</a> gave the challenge a shot. Despite his strong physique, he was soon at the mercy of the Paqui challenge chip. "He just went through the 7 stages of grief," one user wrote. Another chimed in: "When they start slobbering, you know it's over."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@princeoffitness href=#>@princeoffitness</a><p>Damn one chip challenge never againü•µ‚ÄºÔ∏è <a title=hotchipschallenge href=#>#hotchipschallenge</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a> <a title=carolinareaper href=#>#carolinareaper</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Ricky Reynolds" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Ricky Reynolds</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do I participate in the "One Chip Challenge"?</h2><p>The chip is available for purchase on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>. Due to the challenge's popularity, the chip may be out of stock in your area. Be sure to check back frequently, as it is always getting restocked.</p><p>Once you have your chip, ask a friend to film your reaction. While there is no prize for successfully consuming the chip, if Paqui gets a laugh from your reaction video, it may add you to its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall of Infamy</a>. To be considered, tag <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@PaquiChips</a> in your video of two minutes or less on a social media platform of your choosing, and use the hashtag #OneChipChallenge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby1ecKhoKllk52urbjEp56eZaSeuLW7yg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
