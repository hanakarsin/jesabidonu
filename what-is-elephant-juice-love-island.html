The lovebirds may not have taken the show’s cash prize, but they did come in second place. Throughout the season, Luca and Gemma stood out for their chemistry as well as the phrase “elephant juice.”</p><p>Although some fans hadn’t heard the phrase before the show, it reportedly has an adorable meaning for the contestants.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@lucabish</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is “elephant juice” on ‘Love Island’?</h2><p>Luca began saying “elephant juice” to Gemma during their <a href=#>recoupling ceremony</a>. However, Luca eventually grew tired of saying “elephant juice” on camera and expressed as much to Gemma. Soon after Luca’s remarks, fans were confused about the phrase’s meaning.</p><p>“What does elephant juice even mean? I feel like I missed something there #LoveIsland,” one fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in July 2022.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luca Bish (@lucabish)</a></p></figure><p>According to one Twitter user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@h_ollyjones</a>, “elephant juice” means “I love you.” If you look closely, the words cause the mouth to move the same way for both phrases. Initially, Luca kept saying “elephant juice” to Gemma because she was too afraid to commit to saying those magical three words.</p><p>In a July 2022 scene, the couple finally took the next step in their relationship, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>. After telling Gemma that he’s “fallen” for her hard, he says he loves her. Gemma replies, “you’re so cute,” and says I love you, too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When elephant juice turns into I love you 🥺 <a href=#>#LoveIsland</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8VY0ORdFTS</a></p>— Love Island (@LoveIsland) <a href=#>July 14, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Luca Bish and Gemma Owen still together after ‘Love Island U.K.’?</h2><p>Luca and Gemma dated other people until they connected on Day 18.
