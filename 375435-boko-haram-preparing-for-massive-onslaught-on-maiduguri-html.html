According to the reported informants, the military had apparently paid no heed to their warnings. A day later, Boko Haram attacked Maiduguri.</p><p>This account by &nbsp;the locals also corroborates the findings by Amnesty International yesterday, January 28, 2015, &nbsp;<a href=#>that the military command in&nbsp;Monguno&nbsp;had advance warning of the Boko Haram attacks on 25 January. But the military headquarters&nbsp;failed to take adequate action to protect civilians.&nbsp;</a></p><p>A soldier who fled Monguno after it was overrun by Boko haram on Sunday told Sahara Reporters that the militants used to say when they would storm towns and military barracks and carry out such threats. He criticized commanders who boast about working on intelligence, saying they had nothing to show for such ostensible intelligence.</p><p><i>“We should stop defending all the time. There is [an] urgent need for a counter-offensive against Boko Haram,” said a military source. He alleged that the Islamist militants forewarned about their attacks on Baga and Monguno, adding that he had experienced such pre-attack warnings three times.</i></p><p>A resident of a village near Maiduguri said that he and other residents had seen a large number of Boko Haram militants arriving along Dikwa road in sports utility vehicles, motorcycles and camels, adding that they had alerted military authorities as well.</p><p><i>“We have received tips from some of the locals that they have sighted the militants,” a security operative in the beleaguered city told our correspondent.</i></p><p>A member of the civilian joint task force combating the Islamist militants told Sahara Reporters that many of the local people <i>“have vowed to join in the fight to flush Boko Haram out. We are not going to take things [lightly] with them. We are ready for them [Boko Haram fighters]. Since they want to die, we shall kill them.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Buhari Condoles With Boko Haram Victims</a></p><p>However, some residents of Maiduguri say they have not been able to “sleep with two eyes closed since last Sunday,” as one of them stated. He added that the fall of Monguno barracks meant that the militants now control various types of deadly weapons, including artillery weapons with capacity to fire from long distances. “We don’t know when they will come again, but they have the weapons to cause major havoc,” said the resident.</p><p>It would be recalled that attacks &nbsp;by suspected members of the Boko Haram on January 25, 2015, Sunday in Maiduguri was foiled by soldiers. Scores of people including soldiers and insurgents were killed in that decisive battle. The Nigerian Army announced a 24-hour curfew following the Sunday attack.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHiBk2xsZpqfoLxutMCrmKZloKeysa3RoqWgZZakv265wKyqoq6VYryvv8uarKCgpGK8r3nMmqCdrZeqv6p6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
