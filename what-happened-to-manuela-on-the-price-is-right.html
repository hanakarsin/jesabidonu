So many of us love seeing the excitement on someone's face when they realize they've been picked to be a contestant. And there's nothing better than guessing alongside them to see if we could have won all those prizes. Plus, let's not forget that announcer <a href=#>George Gray</a> fills each episode with tons of energy.</p><p>Those who have been watching The Price Is Right consistently over the years are probably familiar with <a href=#>Manuela Arbeláez's</a> face. She's been a model on the show for over 10 years, but recently, fans haven't been seeing her. So, what happened to her? Did she quit? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Manuela on 'The Price is Right'?</h2><p>As far as we know, nothing has happened to Manuela. Actually, she looks like she's been living her best life. Thanks to some Instagram posts, we see that she's on vacation. On Sept. 22, 2021, she posted a selfie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a> and tagged herself at the Goodtime Hotel in Miami. A few days prior, she posted another selfie on the platform and tagged One Hoteles, a chain with locations in Mexico.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>On top of being a model, Manuela is also a mom. She announced her pregnancy on The Price Is Right back in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">March of 2019</a>. She and her husband Matt have a daughter named Tilly and she is their first child together.</p><p>On her Instagram Story, Manuela's got videos of her and Tilly on swings together and playing in a pool alongside a couple of friends.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Manuela recently had a baby!</h2><p>In 2019, Manuela took a break from the show when she had her first child, Matilda (who she calls Tilly).</p><p>She was absent from the show again In October 2022 when her second child, Madeline Mercedes, was born. The pregnancy was announced back in April 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Manuela still on 'The Price is Right'?</h2><p>All signs say that Manuela is still modeling for The Price Is Right and it doesn't look like she's ready to leave. On Aug. 30, 2021, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a selfie</a> on Instagram and tagged the show's sound stage. She's on its 50th season.</p><p>"What an honor to be a part of such an iconic show that’s been around for 50 YEARS," the caption says in part. "We filmed a very special Primetime show that airs on Sep 30th. You won’t want to miss this one so mark your calendars."</p><p>It's possible that Manuela isn't on The Price Is Right currently because she's on vacation. She hasn't publicly said anything about leaving. Plus, all of her social media bios and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her IMDb</a> indicate she hasn't left the show.</p><p>In fact, The Price Is Right actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave Manuela a birthday shout-out</a> on Instagram in September 2021. So it's possible that she's on vacation to celebrate the big day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Price Is Right (@therealpriceisright)</a></p></figure><p>You can watch <a href=#>The Price Is Right</a> on Weekdays at 11 a.m. EST on CBS and stream it on <a href=#>Paramount Plus</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmmZ6qsq2tjKilZqyYmnqxvsicnGaho2K%2FqrPHrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
