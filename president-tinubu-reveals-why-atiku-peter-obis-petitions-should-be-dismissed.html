State (1980) 12 NSCC 291 at 300-301, Marwa v Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1296) 199, 306 — 307, ADH Limited v AT Limited (2006) 10 NWLR (Pt. 986) 635, 649, Awolowo v. Shagari (supra), Abraham Adesanya v. President, Federal Republic of Nigeria (1981) 12 NSCC 146 at 167-168; A.G Abia v. A.G Federation (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt. 763) 265 at 365.</p><p>“The petitioners themselves admit this much in paragraph 107 of their petition, where they listed the FCT as the 37 state, after listing the States mentioned in section 3(1), as numbers 1 to 36.”</p><p>According to Tinubu and Shettima,&nbsp;it was an irony that the LP candidate, who came a distant third in the election, wanted to be declared the winner of the election.</p><p>The respondents stated that the Obi/LP petition was hinged on frivolous claims that the election results were not electronically uploaded to the IREV; that it was not conducted in compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 (EA); and that the Tinubu/Shettima ticket was unlawful because Shettima was not properly nominated.</p><p>They added that Atiku and Obi also based their petitions, riddled with contradicting and conflicting claims, on “some fishing expeditions relating to some purported forfeiture proceedings in the United States of America (US).”</p><p>They faulted the petitioners’ claim about the qualifications of Tinubu and Shettima, arguing that not only did the petitioners fail to prove their allegations both respondents provided ample evidence to establish that they were eminently qualified to stand for election for the office of the president and vice president.</p><p>Tinubu and Shettima added: ”Largely, the election went very peacefully, under a free and fair atmosphere, without proof of violence, ballot box snatching and such other electoral irregularities and vices; a state of affairs to which the petitioners’ witnesses all testified.</p><p>“In fact, the election was conducted in substantial compliance with the principles of the Electoral Act, the INEC Regulations and Manuals for the election.</p><p>“Coincidentally, a host of the witnesses called by the petitioners corroborated the unstable and/ or unpredictable nature of technological devices/applications within the Nigerian terrain.”</p><p>Tinubu and Shettima argued that both petitions are not only without any form or substance, but repetitions, contradictions, and confusion also characterize them.</p><p>The respondents noted that the petitioners cynically alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act on the flimsy ground that the polling unit results were not electronically transmitted and uploaded on the IREV (where collation did not take place); their witnesses admitted that manual collation took place from the polling unit level to the national level.</p><p>They added that while petitioners claimed that Tinubu did not emerge winner with the highest number of lawful votes cast, throughout the petitions and during the trial, “at no portion did they state what they considered as the lawful votes cast for both parties and the number of unlawful votes added to the respondent’s, or the number of votes unlawfully deducted from their own votes.”</p><p>While describing the evidence by the 27 witnesses called by Atiku/PDP and the 13 by Obi/LP as unreliable, Tinubu and Shettima argued that their sole witness successfully established their case.</p><p>They added that their sole witness, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (the Senate Majority Leader), “demonstrated undoubted competence to testify in respect of the subjects submitted before the court, including issues surrounding the US proceedings, himself being a US practicing attorney and counselor at law.</p><p>“Also, being a lawmaker, who participated in the enactment of the Electoral Act, 2022, he stated the position and intention of the legislature, particularly as it relates to the appropriate mode of transmission as well as transfer and collation of results.”</p><p>In rounding off the written address on the Obi petition, Olaonipekun said: “In concluding this address, may we draw your Lordships’ attention to the memorable pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Elias v. Omo-Bare (1982) 5 SC 13 at 22, where Udo-Udoma, JSC, opined thus: “If there was ever any case completely starved of evidence, this is certainly one.</p><p>“This case clearly cries to the high heavens in vain to be fed with relevant and admissible evidence. The appellant woefully failed to realize that judges do not act like the oracles of Ife, which are often engaged in crystal gazing and thereafter would proclaim a new Oba in succession to a deceased Oba.</p><p>“Judges cannot perform miracles in the handling of civil claims, and least of all manufacture evidence for the purpose of assisting a plaintiff win his case.”</p><p>“In every material particular, the above excerpt from the Supreme Court judgment describes this petition in very clear terms.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BvZqmqlai2pbHNrWStoZ6qr7Z50Z6tnpmcqHq4tNhmmK2hm6p6sbHTnqlmp5KewG68xK2graGfo8Buv8eorKWcXZeybrDIrKSiq6OasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
