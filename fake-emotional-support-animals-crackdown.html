"Far too often, flight attendants have been intimidated, bitten, and required medical attention. We are frequently left to deal with behavioral issues, including urination, defecation, barking, and animals becoming loose in the cabin."&nbsp;</p><p>The ruling will allow airlines flexibility to restrict which animals are allowed to fly in the cabin of their planes.</p><p>"It allows airlines to recognize emotional support animals as pets, rather than service animals," according to the Department of Transport.</p><p>In 2018, Jessica Rock, an animal welfare attorney, believes that people are abusing current airline rules and passing their animals off as emotional support animals, despite having no training.&nbsp;“You are seeing a major increase in not only the abuse of people passing off animals of this nature when they’re not in fact service animals or emotional support animals,” Rock told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fox News</strong></a>. “You’re also seeing an increase in the amount of incidents that are taking place on airplanes.”&nbsp;</p><p>Following incidents involving fake emotional support animals, Delta began to require that all those flying with an emotional support animal submit a veterinarian health form and immunization record at least two days before departure.&nbsp;A doctor’s note, signed veterinarian health form and proof of animal training are required at the boarding gate, and certain&nbsp;exotic animals are no longer allowed in the cabin of Delta planes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm66ssYyepKismaS7oriMrKypqJ%2BnwW6tzaKkmqSjYrCzrcKkm6ivng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
