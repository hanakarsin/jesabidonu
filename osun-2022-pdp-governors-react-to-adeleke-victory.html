It shows that everyone matters in politics, particularly the electorate. It also confirms the famous dictum that ‘God’s time is the best.’</p><p>We must remain vigilant and anticipate all the antics the dying APC will come up with. But be rest assured that we are all with you in this great effort to reset the trajectory and story of Nigeria positively.</p><p>“The light has shone on Osun State in July. It is time for the light to shine on Nigeria again through the instrumentality of the PDP, come February, 2023.”</p><p>The forum congratulated the party’s National Chairman and the National Working Committee (NWC) for the victory and also commended Governor Doye Diri of Bayelsa State and his team for a job well done.</p><p>It also applauded&nbsp;INEC, the security agencies, election observers, the media and the people of Osun State, for their conduct during the election.</p><p>The statement further said, “We must also congratulate the PDP family led by the Chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu and his team, who ensured a credible primary. The PDP presidential and vice-presidential candidates must be applauded for their leadership role.</p><p>“Perhaps, a gold medal should be reserved for Sen. Douye Diri, the Bayelsa State Governor, who served as Chairman of the National Campaign Council and other PDP governors and stalwarts who played various roles that culminated in this great outcome.</p><p>“We extend our congratulations also to INEC, the election Management body, the security agencies, election observers and monitors, the media and most importantly, the people of Osun State, who not only voted, but ensured that their votes counted.</p><p>“However, when all is said and done, it is time for the APC to go. It is time to rid Nigeria of the disaster called the APC. The suffering of the ordinary Nigerian has reached a crescendo, a breaking point. The APC should just pack and go, as the PDP, Atiku Abubakar/Ifeanyi Okowa are coming to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.</p><p>“We welcome you to the PDP Governors Forum.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BxZqirpaN6c3yRa2SpnKBitLDCxKulqKqjYr%2BmrcKtZK2nXZaxprjEpJxmrpmYwbC%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
