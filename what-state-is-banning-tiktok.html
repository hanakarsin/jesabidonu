Will the ban actually be put into law — and can the measure be enacted for real? And what does the TikTok ban mean for the rest of the country? Details ahead!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what state is banning TikTok first?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> reports, Montana is the first state to propose <a href=#>an official TikTok ban</a>. The measure passed in the Republican-controlled House and is now being sent to Gov. Greg Gianforte to be signed into law.</p><p>And for its part, TikTok said through a spokesperson, "We will continue to fight for TikTok users and creators in Montana whose livelihoods and First Amendment rights are threatened by this egregious government overreach."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, is TikTok banned in Montana right now?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Acting just like the Chinese government, irony.</p>— The Gen-X Icon (@markbland) <a href=#>April 15, 2023</a></figure><p>Essentially, what the TikTok ban in Montana means for residents of the Treasure State is that if they download TikTok after January 2024, the app store that permits the download faces a fine as steep as $10,000 per day.</p><p>Of course, enforcing the ban is going to be pretty difficult and maybe even impossible.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@iamfiona2pt0 href=#>@iamfiona2pt0</a><p>Montana is just the beginning.

So, we may see Biden looking to enact a TikTok ban nationwide, a move that is not without staunch criticism.</p><p>“He has to make a choice: Does he want to have a confrontation with China over TikTok?” questions James A.
