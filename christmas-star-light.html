The last time a celestial happening like this lit up the sky was nearly 800 years ago, meaning that the most recent human beings who witnessed this were still living in the Middle Ages.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>You'll be able to catch this dazzling display on December 21, 2020 and because of its close proximity to the Christmas holiday, it's been also dubbed as the "Star of Bethlehem."</p><p>So what causes the gorgeous cosmic phenomenon? An extremely rare alignment between Jupiter and Saturn. Rice University astronomer Patrick Hartigan dished out to Forbes what makes this visible star so significant.</p><p>"Alignments between these two planets are rather rare, occurring once every 20 years or so, but this conjunction is exceptionally rare because of how close the planets will appear to be to one another. You‚Äôd have to go all the way back to just before dawn on March 4, 1226, to see a closer alignment between these objects visible in the night sky."</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>To put that into perspective, there's so little known about the year that the Wikipedia entry for it only has a handful of links to specific events.
