The bandits didn’t kill anyone in our community but they took many people in that operation alone. We are waiting for them (bandits) to call for the ransom. Please include my brothers and other victims in your prayers.”</p><p>Saidu communicated this in the Hausa language to his over 4,000 followers and about 5,000 friends on Facebook.</p><p>Subsequently, the former ‘Buharist’ returned to Facebook to say that the kidnappers had contacted the family and family members had started contributing money to pay the ransom. He, however, did not state the amount requested.</p><p>He wrote: “Today, being Wednesday, 29 of December 2021, I, Surajo Saidu Sokoto have dumped the Buhariyya (a Hausa coinage for Buhari supporters) team and have now joined the Kwankwasiya (a coinage for Me Kwankwaso) team. Because bandits abducted my five siblings and I posted it several times but we paid the ransom money and none of them helped me.”</p><p>Recently, Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>visited</a></strong> President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja in the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>wake of the security challenges</strong></a> which rocked the state, <strong>Naija News</strong> recalls.</p><p>The two leaders met about two weeks ago at the presidential villa and discussed the security challenges facing Sokoto including recommendations on the way out.</p><p>The meeting comes barely a week after bandit terrorists attacked some travellers in Sokoto State and burnt scores of them to death.</p><p>The travellers were set ablaze around 10 am in Gidan Bawa village in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of the state as confirmed by the State Police Command, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p>The incident has caused different reactions and condemnations including uproars in some quarters on how human lives seem to have totally lost their value and the criminals killing innocent people at will.</p><p>Following the meeting at the Villa, the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the Governor, Mohammed Bello said his principal urged President Buhari to declare a state of emergency in areas affected by insurgents and terrorists.</p><p>Bello in a statement said the declaration should not only be limited to Sokoto State but be extended to states such as Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Niger Kebbi, and other states where the criminals are operating.</p><p>Gov. Tambuwal during the meeting also appealed to the President to make more weapons available to the military and other security agencies to effectively combat the security challenges.</p><p>He said the use of technology including the deployment of drones should be adopted in the battle against the terrorists and more personnel should be recruited.</p><p>The Governor further called for regional and international collaborations in dealing with the terrorists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5JpZputmJa%2Fqr%2BMnaCeZZiWv6V50q6nqaeiqbKzecOupKmrXZ22rnnAn6ueql2Xrq%2BwyK2qZpmSmcKkwMSdZJ%2Bhppp6sLKMoaCsZZKnvLW0xKuqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
