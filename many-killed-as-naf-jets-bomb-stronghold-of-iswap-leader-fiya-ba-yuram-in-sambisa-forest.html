It could however not be confirmed if the ISWAP leader was also killed in the air strike.</p><p>The source said: “An assessment of the location after the strikes revealed it to be successful, though it remained unconfirmed if Fiya Ba Yuram was among the terrorists neutralized in the strikes”.</p><p>Another military intelligence officer said a similar operation was also carried out at a suspected training camp for ISWAP fighters&nbsp;in the Tunbuns near Lake Chad.</p><p>The terrorists were neutralized in the NAF airstrike.</p><p>“The targets were subsequently acquired and engulfed in flames all after.
