These days, though, the criminal pasts of stars in the franchise and their criminal acts while on the show seem to be more and more prevalent.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You'd be surprised at how many '90 Day Fiancé' stars have been arrested.</h2><p>In some cases, it's a minor infraction, while other arrest records show a history of questionable behavior. The latter is nothing new for some past and present stars, but it certainly lowers approval ratings for them among fans. And, while these may not be all of the stars with shady pasts in the franchise, these <a href=#><u>90 Day Fiancé</u><u> stars</u></a> who have been arrested are definitely some of the more notable.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Douglas Wooten</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>This one is a doozy. When Angela Deem visited a Georgia wedding venue to find a suitable location for her wedding to Michael Ilesanmi, viewers welcomed the commentary from the wedding coordinator, <a href=#><u>Douglas Wooten</u></a>. In January 2021, he was arrested for the murder of another man in Hazlehurst, Ga. where both he and Angela live. His official charges were felony murder, home invasion, armed robbery, and cruelty to children in regard to the murder.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Larissa Santos Lima</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>By now, most 90 Day Fiancé fans know all about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Larissa Santos Lima's criminal history</u></a>. A good portion of her time in the franchise has focused on it, after all. Over the course of her short marriage to Colt Johnson, she was arrested multiple times for battery. The charges continued to follow her the last time she appeared on 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? but she seems to have been able to move past them now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Geoffrey Paschel</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Geoffrey Paschel (@geoffrey.paschel)</a></p></figure><p>Long before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Geoffrey Paschel</u></a> was on 90 Day Fiancé, he was arrested for dealing drugs. He was sentenced to almost a year in jail at the time. He admitted to it on the show when he told then-fiancé Varya Malina, but that's not all he has been accused of over the years. In 2019, he was also indicted on aggravated kidnapping, domestic assault, interference with emergency call, and vandalism when a girlfriend alleged that he slammed her into a wall.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jorge Nava</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 2018, Jorge Nava was arrested after police found almost 300 pounds of marijuana on him. He was charged with possession and the intent to sell and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sentenced to two-and-a-half years</u></a> in prison. When he was released in 2020, he sported a healthier physique and plans to divorce his Russian bride, Anfisa Arkhipchenko, with whom he had originally appeared on 90 Day Fiancé.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Scottie Deem</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Scottie CrazyBeautiful Deem (@london_raes_mommy)</a></p></figure><p>Trouble seems to follow Angela Deem. Her daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Scottie Deem</u></a>, was arrested in 2017 for several counts of molestation when she was accused of having sexual relations with a minor in her home. According to police reports, she had sex with a 15-year-old at her house. She took a plea deal, plead guilty to three counts of child molestation, and was sentenced to serve 20 years in prison. After just 15 months, however, she was released.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul Staehle</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Paul Staehle was found guilty</u></a> of second-degree arson and burning personal property intentionally for insurance purposes. He has never really hid his past on the show, but it hasn't stopped fans from continuously questioning his morals and motives with his wife, Karine Staehle. He explained on the show that his criminal past had to do with a former relationship that ended badly, which really didn't help his case with fans.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé on Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfbn1usMCyZJ%2BhkaOwpnnSrZirq12Wv7Ox0q2cnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
