Click "Settings" in the upper right corner and scroll all the way down the page to the "Account" subheading.</p><p>Here, it should display your current username and what other social accounts (Google, Facebook, Apple) you've linked to your Pokémon GO profile.</p><p>Underneath your username, there should be two green buttons. One reads "Change Nickname," while the other reads "Sign Out." Click "Change Nickname" and select "Yes" when asked if you're sure you want to change your trainer's nickname.</p><p>From here, you can enter a new nickname. Again, you'll be reminded that you can only do this a limited number of times, meaning you'll have to think carefully about what you want your nickname to be. This is the name that will be displayed to other trainers in game.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many times can you change your screen name in 'Pokémon GO'?</h2><p>Unfortunately, you won't be able to change your username often in Pokémon GO. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">help page</a>, you can only alter your username "a limited number of times," meaning you'll want to make your decisions wisely.</p><p>The website does not provide the exact number of times that you're capable of changing your username, but users have reported that it's no more than a handful of times. If you want to change your username, make sure you're confident in your new choice before committing.</p><p>You'll know that you've run out of username changes if the "Change Nickname" option isn't available to you in your settings.</p><p>If you want to change your nickname in the game and you've already used your allotted number of nickname changes, you'll have to submit a report to Niantic to have it changed. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the company will let you continue to change your username, depending on how many requests you've submitted, so be sure to make your username changes wisely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZJygkaO0pnnYqKyrZZ6WuqZ5z6iinqWfo3qouw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
