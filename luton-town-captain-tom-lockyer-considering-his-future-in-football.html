The reason I’m doing so well is all down to the heroic actions of the players, staff, doctors, and paramedics.</p><p>“I feel thankful that this happened to me surrounded by these heroes. They saved my life. I will never forget what you did for me.”</p><p>Luton Town said Lockyer’s cardiac arrest was not the same as his initial collapse during the Championship play-off final in May 2023.</p><p>Atrial fibrillation, defined by the NHS as “an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate” was said to be what Lockyer suffered then. However, he underwent heart surgery in June and was cleared to resume his football career.</p><p>In his social media post earlier today, the Wales international noted that the team’s “fighting spirit” had given him a “much-needed lift” as he continues to recover.</p><p>Note that Luton have been almost unstoppable since December as they have climbed from the bottom of the league table to the 18th spot, winning important matches against Newcastle United and Sheffield United before Christmas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5JqZqWtpKS7bsDOsKVmm5GlwaK1zWarqKVdobykt9ieqWabn6PAqrDEq6Cnn12dtrR5xa6rrqqVYravecWopq2akaG5cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
