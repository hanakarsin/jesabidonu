On Feb. 9, the tracklist for Judas and the Black Messiah dropped — proving that some things never change. The curated collection of songs features a number of heavy hitters, but one collaboration, in particular, has the internet buzzing.&nbsp;</p><p>The film, which details the life of Chicago-bred <a href=#>Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton</a> and his scandalous murder, is scheduled to be released in theaters and on HBO Max on Friday, Feb. 12, but fans are dying to know: Who will be featured on the Judas and the Black Messiah soundtrack?&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>new Jay Z and Nipsey Hussle record to be released on Friday</p><p>off the "Judas and the Black Messiah" soundtrack executive produced by Hit-Boy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/G9M4kNrVnM</a></p>— Complex Ambition (@CmplxAmbition) <a href=#>February 9, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jay-Z and Nipsey Hussle’s posthumous collaboration will be featured on the ‘Judas and the Black Messiah’ soundtrack.</h2><p>Among the artists featured on the Judas and the Black Messiah soundtrack are <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> and late rapper <a href=#>Nipsey Hussle</a>, who have a collaboration on the project entitled “What It Feels Like." The track, which was executive produced by Hit-Boy, serves as Nipsey and Jay-Z’s first official collaboration, but the rappers had a longstanding history of friendship before Nipsey’s death.</p><p>In 2013, Jay-Z showed his support for the rapper by purchasing 100 copies of his mixtape for $100 each. Nipsey thanked the rapper in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV News</a>, saying, “They sent us $10,000, we sent out 100 CDs. I ain’t get the chance to holler at Jay, but through his people, he made it clear that he respected everything, so I was just humbled by it. It felt like it was a good risk. It ended up working out.”</p><p>After Nipsey’s death, Jay-Z and Beyonce appeared at the rapper’s funeral and shouted him out on their collaboration “MOOD 4 EVA.” Jay-Z rapped, “The marathon will be televised for N.I.P. / ‘Cause true kings don’t die, we multiply, peace.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who else will be featured on the 'Judas and the Black Messiah' soundtrack?</h2><p>Along with Jay Z and Nipsey Hussle, a number of other notable hip-hop artists will be featured on the soundtrack, including but not limited to G Herbo, Polo G, Pooh Shiesty, Black Thought, Saba, Smino, and Nas. The film, which stars <a href=#>Daniel Kaluuya</a> and <a href=#>LaKeith Stanfield</a>, has stirred up its own share of controversy, but artist <a href=#>Noname</a> says that she chose not to be part of the project for her own reasons.</p><p>On Twitter, when asked why she wasn’t featured on the soundtrack, the rapper and activist confirmed that this was a conscious decision on her part. She tweeted, “What’s crazy is they asked. I was supposed to be on the song with saba and smi but after seeing the movie I decided to pass.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The artist explained that because she felt that Fred Hampton’s life wasn’t depicted objectively, she encourages viewers to do their own research. She said in a since-deleted tweet, “I hope people actually go study Fred Hampton’s analysis on u.s imperialism and fascism beyond just seeing a movie. Most of his politics were stripped from that film.”</p><p>Judas and the Black Messiah is available for streaming on HBO Max on Feb. 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecmum5qrXZa7pXnToZxmmpyWsKx5zJ6qrKGRnXq0u9Snm62qkZi4bsDRmpqkpJmowW60wKxkmqqinsOmsA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
