Soon after it was released, she received multiple comments from those who passionately disagreed, including rapper <a href=#>Cardi B</a>. Cardi, who has <a href=#>slammed Owens in the past</a>, expressed her feelings about the video on X (formerly Twitter).</p><p>"Girl, shut up," Cardi told Owens after repeating the "disturbing" comments she had made. "You don’t feel one little bit of empathy, a little bit of sympathy of how this woman died?"</p><p>She continued: "There was no argument, there was no conflict. There was no raised voice, and she got shot."</p><p>Cardi also warned Owens, "That could be you one day," and mentioned that she's also a Black woman. Owens responded to Cardi in a follow-up video on July 25.</p><p>Grayson has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct.</p><p><strong>If you are looking for ways to donate your time or money to Black Lives Matter and other antiracist organizations, we have created a </strong><a href=#><strong>list of resources</strong></a><strong> to get you started.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vsMCcnGanp5q7tHnCqKSmnZ6pwG6%2FzqewmmWdlsC0sdg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
