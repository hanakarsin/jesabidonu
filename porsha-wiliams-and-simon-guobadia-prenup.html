In February 2024, one week after she confirmed she would return to the <a href=#>Bravo</a> series after a three-season hiatus, reports surfaced that Porsha <a href=#>filed for divorce from Simon Guobadia</a> after almost15 months of marriage.</p><p>Since Porsha and Simon confirmed their impending divorce, the one-time lovebirds have gotten nasty online and in court. They've accused one another of multiple dysfunctions, including Simon telling Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia that Porsha hired a gunman to come to his house and Porsha accusing Simon of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changing the locks</a> in the $7 million mansion they shared.</p><p>Porsha and Simon have disputed the details of their prenuptial agreement, something RHOA fans have inquired about during their union. Simon also sought court approval to keep Porsha as far from her former home as possible. However, it looks like Porsha might be getting the last laugh.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Simon Guobadia claims Porsha Williams didn't sign her prenup in "good faith" before they got married.</h2><p>On March 27, 2024, Simon requested in court documents obtained by Distractify that his and Porsha's Nov. 17, 2022, prenuptial agreement be further reviewed by Fulton County court. Porsha and Simon signed the prenup five days before their Nov. 22 wedding. The businessman and his attorney, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Onyema A. Farrey</a>, stated, "Additional information is needed through discovery to help this Court determine the circumstances under which the parties entered into the contract."</p><p>Simon also said the court should consider the "validity" and "interpretation" of the prenuptial agreement before being enforced. He revealed in the documents that, upon further insight into his marriage, he believed Porsha never intended for them to stay married when she signed the prenup.</p><p>"Upon information and belief, the Petitioner-Wife [Porsha] did not enter into the Prenuptial Agreement in good faith, or to remain in the marriage with her Husband long-term," the filing read.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stanlo Photography (@stanlophotography)</a></p></figure><p>Simon's claims against Porsha came after Porsha stated in a March 2024 filing that Simon hosted several women while they were living in the same home without her permission. She also stated she had only recently discovered Simon's immigration status was in disarray due to an alleged criminal background, which Simon denied and said he's been a legal U.S. resident since 1990.</p><p>Porsha requested in February 2024 to have her prenup "enforced" by the court, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>Simon's motion also asked for a restraining order against his estranged wife. He asked the court to "exercise its equitable powers" to keep Porsha away, stating she allegedly "violated" their Standing Order from a previous filing. He asked that Porsha stay away from the home and their children. He also asked that Porsha stay in her home she owns and lived in before the marriage, which RHOA fans have heard her refer to as "Porsha's Palace."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fulton County Superior Court</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">In May 2024, Porsha Williams was given “immediate sole and exclusive use” of her and Simon Guobadia’s home.</h2><p>On May 31, 2024, the Fulton County Court granted Porsha a much-needed respite in her and Simon’s tumultuous divorce. In documents from the filing obtained by Distractify, Porsha was given the comforting reassurance of full access to her and Simon’s marital residence.</p><p>The exes have gone to court over their marital home several times, including Simon fighting to <a href=#>ban Porsha from filming RHOA Season 16 in the home</a>. However, the May 31 filing stated Porsha is allowed “immediate sole and exclusive use, control and possession of the marital home” as their divorce proceedings continue. Additionally, Simon is forbidden from entering the home without communicating with Porsha via text or email.</p><p>To be fair, Porsha is also not allowed to visit Simon’s residence without permission. However, Simon was responsible for his share of the marital house’s expenses, including the “monthly mortgage payment, taxes, homeowners insurance, utilities, ADT system, landscaping, community/homeowners association dues and assessments.” Porsha is only responsible for paying the household bills.</p><p>In addition to securing a place to rest her head, Porsha is in no danger of losing her RHOA coins.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to the legal documents, the argument of whether Porsha’s prenuptial agreement permits or prohibits filming/recording in the Marital Residence has yet to be “formally noticed for an evidentiary hearing on the substantive issues surrounding the parties’ prenuptial agreement.”</p><p>Until it is, Porsha is free to use the home as she wishes, as she stated she was allowed to do in her May 20 Emergency Order against Simon, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a>. Porsha's filing came after Simon filed a restraining order against her, claiming she had begun acting "erratic" following their split.</p><p>Porsha and Simon started dating after they appeared on Season 13 of RHOA. At the time, he married Porsha's co-star, <a href=#><strong>Falynn Pina</strong></a>. Soon after he and Falynn separated in January 2021, Porsha and Simon started chatting via Instagram DMs, and it was on from there. During their marriage, the couple had no children together, though Porsha is a mom to her and <a href=#>Dennis McKinley</a>'s daughter, <a href=#>Pilar McKinley</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbyzv8eaZLChnJ6urr%2BMmqWdZaOeurC6jKCsqJqRmbaiec%2BrnKetoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
