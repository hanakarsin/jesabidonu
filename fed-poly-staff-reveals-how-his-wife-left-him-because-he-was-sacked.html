Every effort to let her reason with me and be patient with me failed.</p><p class=p1>“Firstly, my close friend who was also my landlord evicted me from his house because my rent was due and I couldn’t renew it at the appropriate time.</p><p class=p1>“Secondly, it was one of my friends that went and paid for&nbsp;the&nbsp;house, and pressured&nbsp;them to eject me for him to enter the house,” he stated.</p><p class=p1>Wahatana said&nbsp;his problems were compounded&nbsp;when he was saddled with the responsibility of managing his diabetic mother&nbsp;as&nbsp;the first son,&nbsp;and&nbsp;bread winner of the family.</p><p class=p1>&nbsp;“It got to the point that I couldn’t afford her recommended meals and her drugs because there was no money. I watched my mother dying because of lack of money to get her drugs. All these affected my family so badly but thank God for being God.</p><p class=p1>“It is exactly 10 years 4 months now since I was sacked. As a matter of fact, I am alive by the mercies of God. The termination has caused me too much damage that I don’t want to remember,” he narrated.</p><p class=p1>Wahatana described his&nbsp;sacking from the Polytechnic as&nbsp;unlawful and premeditated.</p><p class=p1>“I had&nbsp;no single query, let alone faced any disciplinary committee over anything. I haven’t been indicted for an offence before my termination. It came as a surprise to me.</p><p class=p1>“The termination of my appointment was not just unlawful, but a deliberate and orchestrated plan to possibly render me useless and make me a laughing stock in the society,” he said.</p><p class=p1>According to the aggrieved worker, he tried all means possible to get reinstated, but it did not work.</p><p class=p1>He said he&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;a “&nbsp;series of appeals”&nbsp;seeking for internal redress to no avail&nbsp;until he met&nbsp;a young lawyer, one Barr. Samuel Udoh,&nbsp;who took over&nbsp;his&nbsp;case.</p><p class=p1>With the help of the lawyer,&nbsp;&nbsp;he won the case at the&nbsp;&nbsp;National Industrial Court, Yola, Adamawa State&nbsp;on&nbsp;15th October 2021.</p><p class=p1>The Polytechnic&nbsp;was&nbsp;not satisfied with the judgment&nbsp;and&nbsp;approached the Court of Appeal Yola division.</p><p class=p1>However, on Thursday, last week, in a well considered decision of the Appeal Court in Yola, the application was refused as lacking in merit and accordingly dismissed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;Court of&nbsp;Appeal is the final&nbsp;court in respect of appeals against final decisions of the National Industrial Court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49sZp%2BdlGK9sLjYZqqtmZaberOx1Z6Ypatdnby4eceiqmavmZuybrjEn6tmoJmieqOxwpqsrJ1dnbJuw8CsZKyZk6CypXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
