And we want more.</p><p>The concept is simple — singles from other popular Netflix reality dating shows (and even some non-dating shows!) like <a href=#>Love is Blind</a>, The Ultimatum, and <a href=#>Too Hot to Handle</a>, all commune under one roof for another shot at love.</p><p>Now that Season 1 of Perfect Match has come and gone (why must these shows be so perfectly binge-worthy?), we simply have one question to ask. No, it isn't if Bartise finally worked on his commitment issues!</p><p>Will there be a Perfect Match Season 2? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has Netflix renewed 'Perfect Match' for Season 2 yet?</h2><p>As of March 1, 2023, Netflix hasn't renew Perfect Match for Season 2 yet.</p><p>However, we would bet our left leg that the streamer will renew the series sooner rather than later. After all, some of Netflix's biggest non-scripted (well, that's up for debate anyway) shows are their reality dating series focused on romance (or social media strategy, like <a href=#>The Circle</a>.)</p><p>For all we know, Netflix could have already filmed Perfect Match Season 2 and they're just waiting a suitable amount of time before dropping the second season.</p><p>(After all, <a href=#>Love is Blind Seasons 2–3</a> were filmed back to back, just FYI!)</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who could be a contestant on 'Perfect Match' Season 2?</h2><p><strong>Warning: The following section contains spoilers for </strong><strong>Perfect Match</strong><strong> Season 1.</strong></p><p>Perfect Match had 24 contestants in total, with Dom and Georgia ultimately being voted as the "Perfect Match' in the Perfect Match Season 1 finale. So, who could compete on Perfect Match Season 2? There are some obvious contestants that come to mind, like Cole or Zanab from Love is Blind Season 3 (that is, if Cole isn't actually dating Bachelor Nation's <a href=#>Susie Evans</a>).</p><p>Love is Blind Season 2 fan favorite <a href=#>Deepti Vempati</a> previously told Distractify that she was more interested in hosting her own talk show, so she likely won't appear on Perfect Match Season 2.</p><p>Honestly, we would love to see <a href=#>Frank from The Circle</a> on our screens again just in general, so we would be game to see him on Perfect Match Season 2!</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When could 'Perfect Match' Season 2 drop on Netflix?</h2><p>Obviously those are just a sliver of possible contestant options for Perfect Match Season 2. So if Netflix hasn't filmed Perfect Match Season 2 just yet, when could the second season feasibly premiere?</p><p>We know that Perfect Match Season 1 was filmed in early 2022, but the actual episodes didn't drop on Netflix until Valentine's Day 2023.</p><p>If Netflix follows that pattern for Perfect Match Season 2, more than likely we won't get new episodes until next year. However, if a new season has already been filmed, hopefully the Perfect Match Season 2 release date will be a lot sooner!</p><p>In the interim, you can stream all of Perfect Match Season 1 now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbKzssScq2alkamwqXnSnpisp55ifw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
