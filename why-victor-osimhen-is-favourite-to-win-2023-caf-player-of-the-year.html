Even though he couldn’t help Nigeria qualify for the 2022 FIFA Cup in Qatar, he was able to help the Super Eagles qualify for the 2023 AFCON with ease.</p><p>Osimhen was so good during the qualification series that he scored a whopping ten goals and finished as the highest goalscorer in the entire campaign.</p><p>No player among the players nominated for the award performed as well as Victor Osimhen in the period under review including Achraf Hakimi of PSG and Morocca, and Hakim Ziyech of Morocco and Galatasaray who led their country to finish 4th at the 2022 World Cup.</p><p>The fact that France Football, the organizers of the biggest award in football, Ballon d’Or, <a href=# rel=noopener>recognized Osimhen as the 8th best player in the world</a>, a position none of the CAF award nominees is close to, confirmed that there is nothing that should stop the Nigerian star from winning the 2023 CAF Player of the Year award on December 11 in Marrakech, Morocco.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49qZrCgqWLDqq%2FTqKlmp6OeuqmxzWagrGWWlsOwwdGiq55lpKR6uLXNZmlpamNisKKyjKmjmrGVp3qwsoytn55lqZqus3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
