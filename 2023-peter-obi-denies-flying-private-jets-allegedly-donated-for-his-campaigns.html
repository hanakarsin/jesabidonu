May God Almighty bless those eminent Nigerians always,” the presidential hopeful added.</p><p>After 24 years of ruling Nigeria, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the incumbent government of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has nothing to show for it, said Vice Presidential candidate of the LP, Sen. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Datti made the assertion shortly after a town-hall meeting with party stakeholders and supporters in Minna, Niger State capital on Sunday, October 16, 2022.</p><p>The politician charged citizens of the state and Nigerians at large to not listen to the ‘deceit’ of the opposition parties who according to him, use religion and tribal sentiments to cause hatred amongst the electorates.</p><p>Datti noted that if the previous and incumbent government had done well, Nigeria will not be in this devastating state. He lamented the rising insecurity, corruption as well as other challenges that have bedevilled the country under the APC-leg administration.</p><p>”If the APC and the PDP are better after 24 years combined of governance, why are we still witnessing the challenges we are facing? Nigerians, it’s time to take back our country,” the LP VP candidate noted.</p><p>Reacting to some Presidential candidates and religious leaders in Nigeria who are allegedly telling their members to vote along religious and tribal divides, Datti urged Nigerians to vote for Peter Obi and himself, ignoring such persons to save the country from disintegration.</p><p>“I urge you to ignore such people and vote for credibility, competence, character, equity, fairness and justice to save Nigeria from disintegration,” Datti reiterated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BvZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KeeqWxzaKcrGWWocaqusZmp6uhppbBpnnJnqusZZGhuaazxJ2jsmWUpLuiwMSdZJ%2BnomK1qr%2BMnJimqJGetK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
