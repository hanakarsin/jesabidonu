From entertainment and news coverage to <a href=#>recipes</a> and <a href=#>astrological readings</a> — there’s nothing you can’t find on the internet.</p><p>But the most useful function of social media is offering practical solutions to everyday problems.</p><p>Among the long list of life hacks that have gone viral as of late are the <a href=#>car handle</a> and <a href=#>screwdriver hacks</a>. However, some of the helpful hints that have grown popular online are more helpful <a href=#>than others</a>.</p><p>Let’s take this sage advice brought to us by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> user Lexie Byers’s mom, for example.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@lexie_byers</a></figure><p>According to Lexie, there is a much easier way to remove those pesky adhesive stickers that are normally pretty hard to peel off.

Instead of using a blow dryer to get it off, Lexie offered a life hack that will allow you to say goodbye to your sticker-peeling days forever.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@everydayhomehacks href=#>@everydayhomehacks</a><p>So helpful!! 🤯 did you know about this hack? <a title=lifehacks href=#>#lifehacks</a> <a title=lifehack href=#>#lifehack</a> <a title=mindblown href=#>#mindblown</a> <a title=tiktoklifehacks href=#>#tiktoklifehacks</a> <a title=tiktoklifehack href=#>#tiktoklifehack</a> <a title=momsknoweverything href=#>#momsknoweverything</a> <a title=lifetips href=#>#lifetips</a> Repost @lexie byers</p><a title="♬ original sound - Daily Home Hacks" href=#>♬ original sound - Daily Home Hacks</a></figure><p>Instead of sticking her new set of tumblers in the dishwasher to get the stickers off, she tried out a tip she got from her mom. “My mom taught me this a couple [of] days ago,” Lexie said in the video, which had since gained popularity on social media.</p><p>“So I just bought all these tumbler cups and I was gonna stick them in the dishwasher but each one has like a tag for the barcode under it and they're actually pretty hard to get off. Or are they,” she said mischievously.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@lexie_byers</a></figure><p>Lexie went on to give us a tutorial on how to remove the sticky tags using only a piece of <a href=#>Scotch tape</a>. She instructed: “Anything with like a sticker tag — stop peeling it off [and] grab some tape.”</p><p>“Take your piece and stick half of it onto the tag and rub it so it's really on there. Make sure to leave a little bit of a tail ... then you wax it off!”</p><p>What’s better is you can repeat the process again and again with the same piece of tape!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@lexie_byers</a></figure><p>“Brilliant,” Lexie said of the life hack. And no lies were told!</p><p>Lexie’s tip was reposted on the @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">everydayhomehacks</a> page on TikTok and it really got the people going. In the comment section, many users shared that they were familiar with the tip, too.</p><p>One person chimed in: “That seems just fun to do. Yes, I’ve seen this hack before.”</p><p>Other users were just as blown away as Lexie. “If it works, that’s genius. I just bought some bowls I’m gonna try,” a user named Kelli wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@lexie_byers</a></figure><p>Another commenter teased: “Do not change my life at 2:54 a.m. like this!”</p><p>What you don’t know can’t hurt you, but life hacks like this are sure to get you out of some pretty sticky situations!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGqr8qeqWaskZx6s7HMqK2apF2drqS3</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
