Now, the blonde beauty has a new gig on CBS’ military drama <a href=#>SEAL Team</a>. Scroll down for details about her exciting role.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kristy Swanson joins SEAL Team as Julia Logan.</h2><p>The actress made her debut on the series in the Season 2 episode "Payback," which aired on April 17. She portrays a therapist who meets with the members of Bravo Team as they try to <a href=#>exact revenge after a surprise bomb attack.</a></p><p>Kristy first teased her appearance back in February. "I have some very exciting news! I have officially hooked up with the hit TV Series @SEALTeamCBS," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she tweeted</a>. "It is an honor to be doing this incredible show with @David_Boreanaz and the entire Cast, Exec’s, Writers & Crew.

David, who plays SEAL team leader Jason "Jace" Hayes, hinted in March that Kristy could be a new love interest for his character.</p><p>"I don’t know yet.

"We were doing a take and I had to do some sort of 'Angel' thing... and we were doing this scene and it was the two of us talking and instead of saying her name, I said 'Buffy'... she started cracking up."</p><p>The Bones alum added, "She plays a great character and it's going to be fun to see how her character manages Jason's, I would say, brain and mind, and what he's going through."</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 interview</a>, Kristy talked about the "fabulous" time she had making the film. "I look back fondly at 1992. I’m grateful for that experience and getting to know all those guys," she shared. "Paul Reubens (Amilyn) is still a very good friend of mine and so is Luke [Perry]. I’m still friends with quite a few of the crew members of that movie. Some of them were at my wedding."</p><p>When Luke — who played Buffy’s OG love interest, Pike, in the movie — died suddenly from a massive stroke in March 2019, Kristy was one of the many celebrities who paid tribute to the late star on social media.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>"I abruptly woke at 4:30 a.m. thinking about you Luke & I couldn’t go back to sleep, then 5 hours later I hear you are gone," the actress wrote next to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a photo</a> of the duo on set.
