"So we have to think, 'OK what is our priority?' It's trying to create any content in the interim, and then let's get The Bachelorette."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some fans are finding a silver lining because of the postponement.</h2><p>In an Instagram Live, Clare hinted that they may recast many of the men who were originally set to compete for her final rose. When the cast was originally revealed, many were disappointed with the average age of the contestants being 27-years-old.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Claire explained, ‚ÄúI feel like since we have a break in the show right now, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too late to submit people. So, submit them, why not? What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù</p><p>Chris also chimed in with his thoughts on a possible recasting due to the pandemic just based on scheduling. He explained in an Instagram Live, ‚ÄúThe thought that 25, 30, 35 guys ‚Äî everybody that was able to take time off [then would be able to] come back on The Bachelorette, we don‚Äôt have a set time of when we‚Äôre going to come back. So, the idea that everybody‚Äôs just going to be able to take off work and do this again? Probably very slim.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Chris also confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC was actively casting for both Clare's Bachelorette season</a> and the next Bachelor season, despite not knowing who the Bachelor will be.
