Nineteen (19) Governors voted for Amaechi, 16 voted for Jang. Jonathan recognized Jang. Wike celebrated this evil act.</p><p>“The same Governor Wike in the same year inspired 5 pro-Wike legislators in the Rivers State of Assembly to attempt to take a House of 32 Members with a view to impeaching Gov. Amaechi. Five (5) became greater than 27. Wike was happy and celebrated the evil and now Karma is angry and has decided to visit Wike in like manner.</p><p>“A year after some PDP Governors including Kwankwaso, Nyako, Saraki, Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu and others came to Port Harcourt to sympathise with Amaechi over his ordeals in the hands of Jonathan and Wike, Wike influenced his boys to stone hell out of these highly placed Governors.</p><p>“By 2022 in a Church of God in Port Harcourt, while the presiding Bishop eulogized Wike and commended him for being one of the PDP Presidential candidates, Wike thundered and corrected the Bishop, ‘No! No!! My Lord Bishop, you got wrong, I am not one of the PDP Presidential Candidates but I am the PDP Presidential Candidate even before the PDP Presidential Convention where he was aptly humbled took place. Sadly he used the occasion offered to him in the Church to abuse and curse the whole tribe of Ijaw Nation and he thinks that there will not be consequences for all these actions.”</p><p>Continuing, Eze said “What is happening to Wike at the moment is just an iceberg of the political woes that awaits him and those who collaborated with him to put Rivers State APC in her present state.”</p><p>He added that he believes the PDP presidential candidate, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Atiku Abubakar</a></strong> will not drop <strong>Ifeanyi Okowa</strong> as his running mate and pick Wike as been touted in some quarters.</p><p>“Governor Wike support for the illegality occasioned by the Jonathan’s administration to Jang during the tussle between him and Amaechi for the leadership of the Governor’s Forum may have played a great role in the utterances of the elder statesman not to consider how Wike abused Atiku Abubakar and wants Atiku to appoint him as his Vice. If Atiku had selected Wike as his Vice that would have been one of the wonders of this world.</p><p>“I sincerely sympathize with those asking for Okowa to be dropped for Wike. They are great Jokers because they are totally ignorant of who Atiku I as a man who doesn’t or in the habit of weakening his voice or words no matter the level of pressure.”</p><p>He concluded by saying most of those clamouring for Wike to be the running mate to Atiku are only after what can be their own financial gains if such happens.</p><p>He said… “most of the people claiming to love Wike more than every other person are not actually in love with Wike but the Treasury of Rivers State and to their dismay, Atiku Abubakar dashed their hopes in this regard and saved Rivers State from imminent liquidation and bankruptcy and every Rivers man must return thanks to Atiku for salvaging the little remaining of the state fund.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49xZpqsmaDCbrzDqWScqpmotrR51qKinmWjqrOnsdGipaBllqe8rnnKmqmmmV2bvLN5z5qqrWWjnru0ecSznGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
