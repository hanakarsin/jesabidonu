In layman’s terms, we can use the term "housekeeping" to describe home economics, which literally means working to maintain the livelihoods of people living in a house or apartment. Traditionally, women are mostly the ones who engage in housekeeping, and those women who do not work outside the home are called housewives.</p><p class=align-left>Today, the family’s economy plays a more important role that is not limited to housekeeping. The family is the smallest part of society, which is united not only by blood-related and marital ties but also by economic relations. To satisfy the needs of their homes, families map out time for domestic work and rest, organize everyday life activities, prepare meals and set out processes of receiving goods and services.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a0aae168f98360d6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most popular types of family</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a0aae168f98360d6.jpeg><p class=align-left>The mini-economy of the family involves all available resources of this social cell, especially its properties.

Their results depend not only on the well-being of their single unit, but also on the whole nation. Just like commercial enterprises and the government, households participate in all economic processes.</p><p class=align-left>Simply put, a household is a unit that is run by one or more persons living together and having a common budget. The household unites all employees, owners of material capital, land, securities that are engaged and not engaged in the production process. A household is a concept that is broader than the family, and unlike the family, households includes more than just relatives and can consist of one, two or more members.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a90899ae8332c5c0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hospitality management in Nigeria: Is this a career worth your time?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5uihb8rouu3.jpg><p class=align-left>In the modern economy, the household plays the main role in the social production and spread of goods and services. In different historical periods, depending on the spirit of social relations, the place and role, structure and functions, magnitude and sustainability, rights and responsibilities, position in society or the socioeconomic status of the household have changed.</p><p class=align-left>The household economy is a complex phenomenon of human activities that are constantly changing with time, and it is quite difficult to take the entire spectrum of phenomena and processes occurring within it into account.</p><p class=align-left>The modern household is characterized by heterogeneity, complexity, dynamism and processes occurring in it. In the postindustrial society, the character of economic relations has changed, as well as the role of man in the modern economic system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a90899ae8332c5c0.png><h2>Role of home economics in modern life</h2><p class=align-left>The connection between home economics and households is obvious. You cannot run a successful property without some basic skills of householding. Human activities keep getting more intense and complex, so the main motive for the development of a household is not the multiplication of wealth, but the desire for self-expression in the creative activities of each member. Factors of everyday life such as security, freedom and justice remain most important to them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4dkm2u6hl17.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 main factors of population growth in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Today in Nigeria, without the development of households, a holistic perception of the country's economy is impossible.

Households are owners of resources that come in the form of factor services to firms. The payment for resources serves as a material basis for household incomes and is used to purchase consumer goods and services created by firms. The movement of resource flows, cash, as well as goods and services is carried out constantly within households.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4dth5l8pqel.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Importance of culture in Nigeria shouldn't be underestimated</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6bfo1uguo4n.jpg><p class=align-left>Consequently, the households supply firms and the state with production resources like labor, natural, capital and entrepreneurial skills; and a household cannot be run successfully without the use of knowledge obtained from home economics.
