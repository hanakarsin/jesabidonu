At the same time the opposition party believe that the insurgents are not acting as per some sort of ‘Northern scenario’ as their agenda looks pointless and opaque.</p><p>The statement added that murder of Gen. Mohammed Shuwa by suspected Boko Haram members, assassination attempt on the Shehu of Borno would be never forgotten.&nbsp;</p><p>The APC noted that <strong><a href=#>the late Emir of Kano Alhaji Ado Bayero</a></strong>, had reportedly never recovered, till the very end of his life, of trauma he suffered in the hands of the terrorists.</p><p>However, the opposition party maintained that an attempt to segregate Nigerians, ala in fascist Germany in 1930th-40th, would be the greatest disservice to Nigeria. Boko Haram insurgents would only benefit from such actions aimed at division and separation within the society.</p><p>APC emphasised that stability, unity and harmonious relationship of Nigerian citizens is paramount and fundamental. The party warned Okorocha that introduction of such a measure may result in the situation, when Ndigbo, residing in other parts of Nigeria, would be forced to carry identity cards and would be subjected to screening.</p><p>Okorocha’s proposal of ID cards for the Northerners did not find understanding on social media as well. See some of the reactions below.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mEkmlloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
