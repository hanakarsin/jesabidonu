It's not just Henry Cavill that keeps people coming back to the show, but rather the source material written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. He really has a knack for creating fascinating yet deeply complicated personas.</p><p>Some of his most controversial characters are collectively known as the Rats, and they are about to get the spinoff treatment from <a href=#>Netflix</a>. If the streaming giant chooses to stay true to the books, things could get rather messy. Who are the Rats in <a href=#>The Witcher</a>, and what in the world can we expect from this latest installment? Let's toss a coin, or perhaps some cheese, to the Rats.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Henry Cavill and Freya Allan in 'The Witcher'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are the Rats in 'The Witcher'? It's complicated.</h2><p>The Rats are a gang introduced at the end of Time of Contempt, when one of them helps Ciri escape capture. Like the princess, Kayleigh also lived in a castle that was destroyed by Nilfgaard soldiers. That's not where their similarities end. His adoptive parents were killed in the attack, but a Nilfgaard soldier took pity on him. From here, things get dicey.</p><p>Ciri, who is 14 at this time, is nearly assaulted by Kayleigh but it is thwarted by Mistletoe, another Rat. Unfortunately Mistletoe and Ciri then enter into a sexual relationship that appears to be not entirely consensual because again, Ciri is a teenager. This continues as Ciri joins the Rats in their violent crusade that involves killing and looting. However similar to Robin Hood, they disseminate their riches among the poor. Still, their characters have always come under fire from fans.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Freya Allan as Ciri in Season 3 of 'The Witcher'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Rats appear in Season 3 of Netflix's 'The Witcher.'</h2><p>Though brief a ragtag group of thieves, known as "the Rats" are finally introduced in Season 3 Part 2 of The Witcher. While in the desert, Ciri is captured by Nilfgaard bounty hunters. However, once she is freed by the group, she shows off her sword skills, killing one of the bounty hunters.</p><p>Impressed by her fighting skills, the group becomes intrigued with Ciri, which as fans of the books know, will lead to her teaming up with the group.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Aggy K.

The director's chair will be occupied by Mairzee Almas, who previously directed episodes of Shadow and Bone and The Sandman. This is definitely a great choice.</p><p>Apparently, the only thing that will be carried over from the books is the characters themselves as the plan is to develop an entirely new backstory for the series. In November 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redanian Intelligence</a> reported that "The Rats will be featured in episodes 7 and 8 [The Witcher], when Ciri will first meet them," and will be featured prominently Season 4. Word on the street is, the spinoff will drop between Seasons 3 and 4 of The Witcher.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ciri after the Rats plot in The Witcher <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Tcm55DgAAs</a></p>â€” Lorena Eilhart ðŸ¦‰ (@llorebuffay) <a href=#>September 28, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@llorebuffay</span></figure><p>As far as casting goes, The Rats are already scurrying about.<strong> </strong>Christelle Elwin (Half Bad) will be playing the part of Ciri's love interest Mistle, though it hasn't been revealed if Ciri will be making an appearance in the spinoff. She is joined by Ben Radcliffe, Fabian McCallum, Aggy K. Adams, Juliette Alexandra, and Connor Crawford who are Giselher, Kayleigh, Iskra, Reef, and Asse respectively.</p><p>Rounding out the cast is action star and chemical engineer degree holder Dolph Lundgren, who<strong> </strong>is a "ruthless rogue witcher from the School of the Cat called Brehen." We first meet him in Season of Storms. Fingers crossed this spinoff fares better than the Blood Origin prequel.</p><p>You can now stream The Witcher Seasons 1 through 3 on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecCrnGasmJp6s63TrGStoJVixKrAwqGcqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
