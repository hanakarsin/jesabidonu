Early in the season, tensions ran high between <a href=#>Gia Giudice</a> and Joe Gorga, which resulted in an explosive family feud.</p><p>After Joe (eventually) offered an apology, their dispute was put to rest. But following their truce, Teresa was forced to put out yet another fire.</p><p>In the Season 12 premiere, rumors came to light about Teresa’s boyfriend, <a href=#>Luis “Louie” Ruelas</a>, after a <a href=#>bizarre and confusing video</a> surfaced online. Now, her RHONJ castmates are wondering if her beau is really who he claims to be.</p><p>Though we’ve seen Louie pretty frequently onscreen, not much is known about his background. For example, what exactly does the reality star do for a living? Read on for details on Louie's job, net worth, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@louiearuelas</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'RHONJ's Louie Ruelas has a job in the advertising industry.</h2><p>Louie is one of the five co-founders behind <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Media Solutions</a> (DMS), a Florida-based digital marketing company that uses its proprietary technology to create “a more efficient advertising ecosystem” and help businesses “dominate social media”.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, the company was first founded in 2000. Today, Louie acts as the executive vice president of business development and has accumulated an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p>Despite the bad press that Louie has received lately, he’s definitely done a few good deeds in the past. In May 2020, a few months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he partnered with a nonprofit to feed more than 300 families in Harlem, N.Y.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@louiearuelas</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Teresa Giudice and Louie Ruelas first met in 2020.</h2><p>Teresa first met her tech entrepreneur boyfriend in the summer of 2020, and they made their relationship public months later. It wasn’t long before Louie made his RHONJ debut.</p><p>The couple announced their engagement in September of 2021. However, some glaring red flags have come to light since the couple started dating.
