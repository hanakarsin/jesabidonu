He graduated from Jacksonville University with a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Kinesiology and Exercise Science in 2013. Culver played lacrosse during his time at the university. He worked as a personal trainer afterwards, before he got into yachting.</p><p>On the Australian series, Culver also talked about how close he is to his parents (Cass and Kim) and to his older brother, Trey, and his younger sister, Teracina.</p><p>"I'm very close with my family..." Culver said in the third episode of the Peacock original. "The most important thing to me, at the end of the day, is my family."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When he's not working on boats (he is currently based in Florida) or spending time with his loved ones, Culver often dons a bleach-blond mullet wig as part of his alter ego, Keith Stone. Based on the teaser trailer for Below Deck Down Under, it looks like Keith will be making a cameo at some point in the show.</p><p>Here's to hoping that Culver will dress as his alter ego to twin at some point with Summer House star Kyle Cooke and his own blond mullet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Culver Bradbury dating?
