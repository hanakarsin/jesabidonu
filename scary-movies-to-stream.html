Stine. <a href=#>Fear Street</a> follows a group of teenagers living in the 1990s as they investigate a great evil haunting their town in a ghost story that spans several centuries.</p><p>The film series was released in three parts over the month of July 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Censor</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Magnolia Pictures & Magnet Releasing</a></figure><p>When film censor Enid discovers a clue to her sister's disappearance in an unsettling horror video, she begins to investigate its director.

It will be available on <a href=#>Hulu</a> starting Oct. 14 as part of its "Huluween" horror celebration.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Malignant</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figure><p>Director James Wan brings his twisted vision to this 2021 film. Madison is plagued in her sleep by terrifying visions of violent murders. Unfortunately, she makes the horrifying discovery that these strange nightly visions are all too real.</p><p>Though <a href=#>Malignant</a> received a theatrical release on Sept. 10, it also came out on the same day on HBO Max.

Inside and isolated from the world (save for some spotty phone and TV reception), he tries to survive both the zombie apocalypse and his own terrifying solitude.</p><p>Released in 2020, #Alive rings very similar to our own quarantine experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic. If you're looking for a horror film that depicts a reality not too far from our own (that also has zombies), then look no further. #Alive is streaming on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLCivthmpKiumZrAbsDOZqqtqpWWug%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
