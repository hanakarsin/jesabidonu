Distractify confirmed Bill's passing via his representatives.</p><p>While no official cause of death has been made public, Bill did just celebrate his 90th birthday, meaning that his passing could have had something to do with a health issue caused by old age â€” however, this is just speculation at this time.</p><p>In an exclusive statement, Bill's rep Carmela told Distractify, "He was in a wheelchair [for the] last few months, including a caretaker... he could stand to do some things, but for just a few minutes."</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a> from a relative of Bill's, Thomas G. Cobbs, states that "Bill passed away peacefully at his home in California ... As a family we are comforted knowing Bill has found peace and eternal rest with his Heavenly Father. We ask for your prayers and encouragement during this time," the post continued. Distractify has reached out to Thomas for additional comment.</p><p>Bill's representative also told Distractify, "He is the most gentle man you could ever meet. The most amazing man ... They just don't make them like him. He is a legend in every way you can imagine. As a human, a performer, you can't get better than Bill Cobbs."</p><p>Our thoughts are with Bill's family and fans at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobKosc2dmKuxXZawtbvRZpmipJxisLCuwaxknZ2RmXqiwIxyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
