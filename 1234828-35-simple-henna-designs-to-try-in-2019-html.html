The tattoo above is full of quirky futuristic patterns, such as geometry, swirls and dots. Another creative thing about it is the way it covers all the fingers, but not the ring finger, because there is a ring accessory on it. Finally, minimalist nail polish would be suitable for this kind of art.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6g1oi7hrre.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Nigerian native styles for men and women</span></p></a><h3>26. Henna glove with a bracelet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2a4824455469654c_w.jpg><p class=align-left>Of course, these are not the real glove and bracelet, but if you have a quick look at this tattoo style, you will mistake it for them. This makes sense because this mehendi design covers almost the entire hand. These designs are not very complicated to draw once you achieve and develop the skill of mehendi. Intricacy matters here as the styles are all closely connected.</p><h3>27. Red art</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7fd74033425d2012.jpg><p class=align-left>We have already gone through the designs that cover your entire hands and create a perfect illusion of a handwear, but the designs which are situated less close to each other can also be very imaginative. For example, this one truly looks like space full of various objects, like stars, flowers and patterns. The colour red is always the colour of victory and greatness so it would be an awesome choice for your beautiful tattoo.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytsd9lci76hco.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Braid lovers, this hairstyle collection was made just for you.

White Elegance</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ab070606346e3fc2.jpg><p class=align-left>White henna tattoos are something fresh and original, so you could totally try them out if it is your special day. You will have no regrets about doing such a courageous thing because such a tattoo looks absolutely brilliant together with a magnificent white wedding dress. Besides, you will get some miraculous photos of your spouse sliding the ring on your finger. Is it not worth the effort?</p><h3>29. Easy wrist designs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7v3ui2tlbm7.jpg><p class=align-left>In case you are not ready for the hand styles yet, you could start with a henna painting on your wrist. At least, if something goes wrong, you could cover it with clothes. A wrist design is a good way to practice before you move on to the more complicated mehendi, so it is recommended to people who are new to this fantastic world of art. Some of the easiest drawings you could create are the spirals, circles, nets and flowers. You will not even need high artistic skill for this: just follow your heart and do what it tells you to do. The result might surprise even yourself!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cbf3b32dd8cd9e25.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ stunning Guinea brocade styles that are a must-have in your wardrobe</span></p></a><h3>30. Elegant twin tattoos</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/87297ded928e48ba.jpg><p class=align-left>Green represents renewal, safety and growth. Also, it can be a symbol of your lifelong friendship with someone who means a lot to you. If this is the case, but you are not ready to get real matching tattoos, you can get the symmetric henna ones! Look at this gorgeous flower design: it is absolutely worth working at for some time. What makes it easy is that you and your friend can help each other draw this style on your hands.</p><h3>31. Very simple brown flower</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/53989c5f66a2de22.jpg><p class=align-left>Maybe you have always considered yourself devoid of any artistic talent and thought you would never pull off these breathtaking henna designs, but only ruin your hands and waste the paint instead. It is completely fine: some designs really do not require any skill, just enjoyment and passion. This is one of them: all you need is to draw some easy lines and flowers on your hands. In the end, it would still turn out to be very cute and original.</p><h3>32. Vintage style</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7b1ftqadfah.jpg><p class=align-left>What if you are a fan of old movies, songs and everything that is at least fifty years old? If this is a description of you, then you would enjoy these fabulous designs. The best thing about them is that they actually have some modernity in them, such as all the asymmetry. Drawing them would not be too hard either – paint some flowers, dots and rings on your fingers, and you are ready to go into the world with them on your hand.</p><h3>33. Full hand paint</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1c4a33829a23bc67.jpg><p class=align-left>Sometimes you want to go a little crazy, and what is better than covering your hands entirely with a henna tattoo? Believe it or not, there is a lot of hidden symbolism in these drawings: you can find some letters and signs there if you look closely. This kind of style is for people who are not afraid of life and challenges, and always go through all the difficulties with their head held high.</p><h3>34. Minimalist orange design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9fe332bda03ab436.jpg><p class=align-left>On the contrary, if going to extremes is not what you enjoy doing, then you can give your preference to this hand art, which is suitable for romantic occasions like weddings. It is full of sophistication, elegance and charm. The colour orange is usually associated with joy and enthusiasm, which everyone needs so much in their life. If you feel like such a tattoo would suit you better than lush black scribbles, then you should go for it.</p><h3>35. Simplistic leaves</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt64kn2jde9bm.jpg><p class=align-left>Finally, we saved probably the easiest one for the last. This is a tattoo that every beginner could pull off, and you are not an exception. The interesting thing about it is that you can only draw leaves and spirals, and it is not necessary to paint them flawlessly. You can let your fantasy shine and make the result a little different from the reference – whatever suits you most.</p><p class=align-left>These simple henna designs are super trendy and impressive this season.
