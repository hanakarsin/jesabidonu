If we are being literal, it is the thing that occupies a person’s time and brings them money in return for hours spent. Synonyms of occupation are employment, job and, in some cases, even profession. However, it is occupation that you mostly see in many official documents that require information about your employment status.</p><p class=align-left>Anything that earns you money is an occupation. Most occupations do not require any special skills or prior training. However, this results in lower wages and decreased stability. Some people go through dozens of occupations throughout their lives to stay afloat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/12f679af69dcc65d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best discipline quotes to motivate you each morning</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did you know?</p><p class=align-left>There is also a different occupation meaning. It can also mean the military presence of one country on the territory of a different country. However, it has nothing to do with what we are talking about, so we will not spend too much time on it.</p><p class=align-left>Now that you know what occupation means, take a look at some of the examples of different occupations.</p><h3>Occupation examples</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/12f679af69dcc65d.png><p class=align-left>We live in a time when there are more occupations than we can even comprehend.

These individuals possess certain skills and knowledge that come from training, education and research, which are recognised by the wide public. Profession is a way of applying the exercise and knowledge of said individuals for the good of others (and earning them some money in the process).</p><p class=align-left>It might surprise you, but profession is actually a type of occupation. However, it is not a regular occupation. Profession requires significant prior education and training. It is essentially what we attend universities for, to learn a profession.</p><h3>Profession examples</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f11e91fc9d2931da.jpg><p class=align-left>Just as with occupations, there are many professions out there.

While profession can also describe the result of formal education.</li><li>While occupation can mean any type of job (waiter, lawyer, janitor, astrophysicist), profession only encompasses jobs that require special training and education (web-designer, game developer, sociologist).</li><li>Profession could be considered a subset of occupation. This means that the term ‘occupation’ contains several subcategories, among which is ‘profession’.</li><li>In occupations, people earn money for the time they spend on the job. In professions, people earn money for their skills and expertise.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49581010aebd09f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benefits of social studies</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt10ht13n0t0f.jpg><ul><li>In some instances, profession can also point to higher status and respectability than just any regular occupation.</li><li>A person’s profession and occupation can differ.

This means that Mark has studied to become a dentist, but he works as a copywriter instead.</li><li>Usually, people change multiple occupations during their lives. However, most people have one or maybe two professions, while some have none. In the same line, you can change occupations, but profession stays with you for life; you can only add more to the list.</li></ul><p class=align-left>And there you go, now you can tell the difference between occupation and profession.
