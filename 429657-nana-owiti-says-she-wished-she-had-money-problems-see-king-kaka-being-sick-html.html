You may be struggling financially but that should not be your main focus. For me, I just want to live confortably even without money. As long as I have wealth in health," Nana said.<h2>Kaka's illness an eye-opener</h2><p class=align-left>The TV host added that it got to a point she wished she was suffering financially than having to see her man suffer in sickness.</p>"For me, seeing King sick for that long really drained my soul. I was even calling my friend and would tell her that I wish I was struggling with finances but not health. When you are healthy, you are able to solve financial problems, but when you are not, it is totally different," she added.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d835aafc04f3a5e2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>King Kaka's Wife Nana Discloses Why She Tastes Rapper's Food Before He Eats</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Just recently, Nana disclosed she was forced to become King Kaka's connoisseur when the rapper became sick.</p><p class=align-left>Nana noted that a lot of things in their lives changed including the foods the rapper eats and how he eats.</p><p class=align-left>In a social media post seen by <strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong> on <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/429186-nana-owiti-narrates-horryfying-experience-king-kaka-sick-he-knocked-deaths-door.html href=#>Nana's Instagram page</a> just recently, the mother of two disclosed that they rarely eat in hotels.</p><p class=align-left>According to Nana, they, specifically Kaka can only eat at a hotel where food had been prepared following her prior orders and directions on how it should be cooked.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Nana </a>went on to reveal they most eat at home or at King Kaka's mother's home where they are sure of how the food has been prepared.</p><p class=align-left>The TV host went on to add that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she also tastes all the food the rapper eats before he takes them</a> to make sure no spices had been used and to confirm just how it is supposed to be made for Kaka.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkXJtbm9do66vrYyorqKsmWLAosXSZqqhnV2strS0xJ1krKCVYrWisIympqedqWK9s7vBpZymq12osqZ5yqKloGWblriiecGeoKefXai2pLeNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
