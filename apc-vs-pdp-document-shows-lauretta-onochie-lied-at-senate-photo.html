Thus, nobody has anything to fear. I am madam due process and this is the reason behind my attacks, because I follow the law and due process,”&nbsp;Onochie told the senators.</p><p>“Since Buhari was elected as president for the second term, I have removed myself from everything about politics.</p><p>“Since 2019, I don’t have anything to do with politics. As I am sitting down here, I am not a member of any political party in this country.”</p><p>But an affidavit she sworn on June 30, 2021, at the FCT High Court, Abuja, clearly contradicts her position at the senate.</p><p>In the affidavit, she clearly indicated that she remains a member of the APC and was an active participant in a United Kingdom election where she also contested.</p><p>She equally disclosed her membership of President Muhammadu Buhari’s support organization.</p><p>Part of the affidavit read: “That I am an educationist having served as Headmistress of Auntie Margaret International School, Calabar. I have also served as a lecturer at the Epping Forest College, Essex, United Kingdom.</p><p>“That I am also engaged in active politics and a member of the Neighborhood Watch and has also contested the Local Government elections under the Conservative party in the United Kingdom.</p><p>“I am also a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress and a volunteer at Buhari Support Organization.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-405096 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lauretta-onochie-document.jpg alt width=1152 height=1536 sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-405096 class=wp-caption-text>Onochie sworn affidavit</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49yZpqok2LDtHnPnadmnJ%2BYwq6xza1krKCfrMBuuMCuqZ6spJZ6sLrOnJ%2BinV2htqawjJqrZquVo661sYypn6isn2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
