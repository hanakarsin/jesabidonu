She also shared a shot of the exterior of the house, which was still covered in plaster, as well as a shot of her "favorite view," which showed the body of water in front of her home. Fast-forward to June 2024, and Simone shared a sneak peek at her kitchen, with its gorgeous waterfall black-and-white countertops (we can't tell if it's marble or quartz, but it's beautiful!) and white cabinets.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Simone Biles shares a kitchen update in her Texas home with husband Jonathan Owens via Instagram story.

She also previously had a place with Jonathan in Green Bay, Wisc. (which makes sense considering Jonathan played for the Green Bay Packers at the time), but not much is known about this residence, and we're guessing they don't need it anymore.</p><p>Here's hoping that Simone and Jonathan build a lifetime of great memories in their dream Texas abode.
