A <a href=#>TikTok</a> video for one teen's student council campaign has currently taken over the platform for its hilarious nods to <a href=#>Mean Girls</a>. But instead of Regina George being at the center of this story, it's a teenage girl named Maya Dodge, who has a really good campaign team.</p><p>See why the internet is obsessed with her campaign video below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who Is Maya Dodge? Her student campaign video has received millions of views on TikTok.</h2><p>In a video shared by the account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@maya4stuco</a> on May 8, 2023, a handful of students encourage viewers to vote for their friend Maya Dodge during their school's student council elections.</p><p>And just as students adored Regina George, the Queen of the Plastics in Mean Girls, these students were equally enamored with Maya.</p><p>‚ÄúMaya‚Äôs single so I broke up with my boyfriend," said one girl at the beginning of the video as she teasingly pushed her boyfriend away.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@maya4stuco href=#>@maya4stuco</a><p>make sure to vote MAYA DODGE for STUCO wednesday, may 24th !! üî•üî• <a title=reginageorge href=#>#reginageorge</a> <a title=studentcouncil href=#>#studentcouncil</a> <a title=maya4stuco href=#>#maya4stuco</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Bomb Intro / Pass That Dutch - Missy Elliott" href=#>‚ô¨ Bomb Intro / Pass That Dutch - Missy Elliott</a></figure><p>Next up, two male students can be seen saying, ‚ÄúMaya likes boys so I like boys.‚Äù This is followed by a girl with long curly hair who says, ‚ÄúMaya said she liked my curly hair, so I never straightened it again.‚Äù</p><p>Basically, Maya's classmates are (jokingly) obsessed with her and only want to please her. The TikTok video ‚Äî which parodies a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">classic Mean Girls scene</a> ‚Äî continues to show her peers flattering her.</p><p>But in an unexpected turn of events, the video seemingly reached way more folks than just Maya's classmates. It reached people all over over the world.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>In the comment section, complete strangers were already fans of Maya. "I live in Kenya but vote for Maya," wrote one user.</p><p>But what's even more interesting is that Maya is not believed to be in this video promoting her campaign; rather, it's just her classmates. That said, many viewers are pining to know what she looks like, asking for a "Maya reveal" in the comments.</p><p>Fortunately, @maya4stuco's account continued to stay active since the campaign video went viral, and even uploaded a few follow-up videos in which Maya did allegedly appear.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@maya4stuco href=#>@maya4stuco</a><p>were gonna ignore how the air pod didnt work as a micüëç <a title=maya4stuco href=#>#maya4stuco</a> <a title=studentcouncil href=#>#studentcouncil</a> <a title=schoolinterviews href=#>#schoolinterviews</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - maya4stuco" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - maya4stuco</a></figure><p>However, to viewers' chagrin, she had her face covered up with a hoodie, further dragging out the mystery of who she really.</p><p>While it's unknown what area of the U.S. Maya and her friends hail from, we do know that her school's student council election will take place on May 24, 2023. The account also noted in its bio that it would reveal Maya's face soon, but it's unclear when.</p><p>That said, even if Maya doesn't win her student council election, she definitely has TikTok's vote. And her friends definitely have future jobs in campaigning and publicity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq66rYyfpqtlo6nCpbHNrWScp6WjsKq4jK2gpKyfoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
