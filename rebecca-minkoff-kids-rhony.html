According to Gavin's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, he's a seasoned Director, Writer, and Creative Lead who has helped brands like Netflix, Vogue, Under Armour, and Viceland tell their stories through various platforms, including "broadcast, streaming, and social platforms."

In one scene from the trailer, Brynn asks, "Is she pregnant again?" to which <a href=#>Erin Lichy</a> replies, " Yeah, that's why she's not drinking." Then, <a href=#>Jessel Taank</a> is seen telling her mom that someone in the group had a baby by someone who isn't her primary partner.</p><p>"She had this wild night and ended up getting pregnant by some other guy," Jessel claims.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait so that Rebecca lady got pregnant from another guy?
