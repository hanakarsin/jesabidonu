While others have seen the dreaded animal in other parts of their homes.</p><p>This has led to a huge fear amongst Nigerians as it is not so often that we hear of people dying from snake bites in Nigeria compared to other countries like India.</p><p>This fear of snakes has made people more cautious about their surroundings especially the restroom. While there might be certain steps to take to avoid your home from being invaded by this reptile, you can also employ certain measures if your techniques fail and a snake attacks you.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/snake.jpg alt="Twitter Users React As Snakes Send President Out Of Office" width=640 height=536 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Leave the snake alone:</strong> Do not try to attack the snake. This will probably not end well as snakes are quite fast and you would have wasted precious time you could use in saving yourself.</p><p><strong>Don’t panic and don’t move</strong>: While this is easier said than done, it would be in your best interest to remain calm as sudden movement would make the venom travel faster. If you are sure you are no longer in danger, stop moving and take calm breaths. It is actually rare for people to die from snake bites if they follow first aid steps. You can cry out for help wherever you are without moving or make a call with your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Apply pressure on the site of the bite</strong></p><p>Snake bites often occur in the limb, leg, feet, hands, and arms so apply a pressure immobilization bandage while you await help from medical professionals.</p><p><strong>Don’t wash the snakebite site:</strong> Don’t try to wash the site of the bite with any form of liquid. Also, keep clothing off the bite mark as any form of movement could make the venom travel faster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5JpZqGnp2LBsHnSmq2eZamkwrN5y6KdnmWRm8GmvoyaZKymkaCybq7IrZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
