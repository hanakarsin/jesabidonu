Many players have joked about this, including former Pro Bowl running back <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arian Foster</a>, who appeared on the Macrodosing podcast in January 2023 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">humorously claimed</a> everyone receives a few scripts during training camp every year.</p><p>Now, when it comes to the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>, some fans are still convinced the NFL is fixed in that the teams playing in the big game are predetermined. If you're desperate for proof, look no further than the Super Bowl logo, which allegedly features the primary colors of both teams in the game.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What to know about the conspiracy theory surrounding the Super Bowl logo.</h2><p>On Nov. 3, 2023, TikTok creator Anna Rachel (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@annnarachel_</a>) fueled the Super Bowl logo colors conspiracy theory. In the video, she pointed out that the NFL debuts a new Super Bowl logo at the start of every regular season.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Anna explained that although no one knows ahead of time who's playing in the Super Bowl, the official logo features two colors â€” and they're almost always the primary colors of the teams that end up in the game. Sure, this sounds a little absurd, but if we look back at the past logos, it doesn't seem so far-fetched.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"In 2022, the logo had orange and yellow," Anna told her followers, adding that the "teams that played in that Super Bowl were the <a href=#>Bengals</a> and the <a href=#>Rams</a>." She added, "In 2023, the logo had green and red, and the teams that played in the Super Bowl were the <a href=#>Eagles</a> and the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a>."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Super Bowl logo colors are inspired by the host city.</h2><p>While it's a decent theory, the Super Bowl logo colors are actually inspired by the host city. If we look back at the 2022 big game, which took place at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., the official logo incorporated palm trees and colors that reflect the Golden State's breathtaking sunset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for the 2023 Super Bowl, which was played in Glendale, Ariz., the logo showcased the state's stunning landscape and featured the use of teal, red, and purple, which are the colors that make up Arizona's state flag.</p><p>Lastly, the 2024 Super Bowl will be the first to be played in Las Vegas, and the logo keeps up with recent tradition and includes the host city inside the numbers. It features quite a few designs of some of the city's most famous hotels and casinos, including the Bellagio. For those curious, the color scheme mimics a sunset over the Las Vegas Strip.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMKxsdFmmaivnGK5sLPOZpqopJ%2BnwG6vzqeqqaGilrC6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
