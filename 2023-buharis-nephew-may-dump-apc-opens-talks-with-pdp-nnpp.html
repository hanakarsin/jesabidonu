They are all looking for me; they know what it means to have me if the APC doesn’t know my value. I will soon make a decision.</p><p>“When it is time, I will make it public, but I made a press statement after the primaries where I stated that we had written a petition to the national appeal committee, and they had concluded their report, but unfortunately, with the connivance of the state government, they were stopped from submitting it.</p><p>“So, they are not helping the system. Those that are helping the party are not the ones the system wants. Politics is all about give and take, so we are looking for a possible way out, but they are feeling the impact. They lost the ground, and they don’t have the footing; they are scared, that is why they are doing all these things.</p><p>“I am comfortably okay as far as I know in my constituency they can’t do anything without me politically. But I have not made my final decision. If I am staying, I will let you know, and if I am leaving, I will let you know as well.”</p><p>He denied threatening to scatter the APC after he lost a ticket to return to the House of Representatives.</p><p>According to the lawmaker, the APC would find it difficult to win the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>He said, “Scatter the party as how? They have already scattered their party, what is left? They have already disorganised the party since there was no primary election.</p><p>“They should just lick their wounds as they are already an embarrassment. They can’t win even a single LGA not to talk of general elections because they are fighting those that will work for them since they don’t want people to understand what politics is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FtZmtoYmh6o8HHmqmiq12jsrG0xLBkppmpYrG2uc9mmKmbXaS9prrSZquapJuoeri106FkqZygYruvvM9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
