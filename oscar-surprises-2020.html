Once a year, film buffs and movie enthusiasts pause whatever they're watching to debate which movies, actors, and directors truly deserve praise from The Academy. And as always, the Academy's choices aren't always considered to be the "popular opinion."</p><p>With the reveal of this year's nominees on Jan. 12 came several snubs and unexpected nominations.

That being said, Twitter is furious Jennifer Lopez wasn't nominated for Hustlers, Awkwafina didn't get anything for The Farewell, and Lupita Nyong'o didn't snag any noms for Us. Greta Gerwig also wasn't nominated for directing Little Women, and Portrait of a Lady on Fire wasn't nominated for anything.</p><p>With that, a long list of white, male-centric films like The Joker are completely dominating this year's list of Oscar nominees ‚Äî in fact, the villain-focused drama, starring Joaquin Phoenix, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took the lead at the Academy Awards this year</a> after snagging a total of 11 nominations, according to WSJ.
