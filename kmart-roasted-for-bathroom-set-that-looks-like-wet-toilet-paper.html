In a voiceover, she notes that she typically loves a matching homeware set from Kmart, but she wasn't feeling this particular bathroom set.</p><p>Showing the ‚Äúthree products you do not need to buy‚Äù from Kmart, Lucky held up an $8 soap dispenser, a $6 toothbrush holder, and a $14 toilet brush holder, all boasting the same design.</p><p>As Lucky would go on to indicate, she believed these products looked a liiiiittle too much like toilet paper.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@luckyleporidae href=#>@luckyleporidae</a><p>Has anyone actually bought these?? <a title=kmart href=#>#kmart</a> <a title=kmartfinds href=#>#kmartfinds</a> <a title=kmartaustralia href=#>#kmartaustralia</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Lucky üê∞" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Lucky üê∞</a></figure><p>‚ÄúUnless the aesthetic you're going for at home is ‚ÄòI've stocked up on toilet paper,‚Äô you don't need this soap dispenser, you don't need this toothbrush holder, and you don't need a matching toilet brush.
