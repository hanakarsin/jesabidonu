He questioned the actress about what she wearing on the slopes the day of the incident and about her friendship with <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</p><p>Wait, why was Sanderson's attorney asking about Gwyneth and Taylor's friendship?

One of the questions Kristin had for Gwyneth on the stand was whether or not Gwyneth had been inspired to countersue Sanderson for $1 in 'symbolic damages' because Taylor won a similar countersuit against DJ David Mueller in 2015.</p><p>Gwyneth denied that her countersuit was inspired by Taylor's. She said she was "not aware of it" at the time she filed her own countersuit of $1 against Terry.</p><p>Kristin then asked if Gwyneth considered herself to be good friends with Taylor. Gwyneth replied, "I would not say we're good friends...We are friendly. I've taken my kids to one of her concerts before, but we don't talk very often."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Attorney in the Gwyneth Paltrow trial ðŸ˜­ðŸ«  <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UeDANxW5pn</a></p>â€” Danielle Pinnock (@bodycourage) <a href=#>March 27, 2023</a></figure><p>Seemingly unconvinced, Kristin then asked Gwyneth to confirm or deny if she ever sent Taylor "intimate" Christmas gifts.
