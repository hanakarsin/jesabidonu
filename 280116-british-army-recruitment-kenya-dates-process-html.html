The British Military hopes to draft recruits to address the shortage. The regular British Army is projected to be 82,000 strong.

In this case, if you successfully earned an opportunity to join the British Army, you will be subject for an <a id=https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/our-schools-and-colleges/afc-harrogate/ href=# title="British army foreign recruitment British army overseas recruitment British army recruitment process" rel="nofollow noopener">exempt from immigration control</a>. Since the training takes place in mainland UK, this will come in handy. The granted status will be valid for the period you will be in training until the time you get discharged from the Army.</p><p class=align-left>The initial basic training (Phase 1) will encompass instructions on fieldcraft, survival skills, first aid and army weapons handling. During the same time, a recruit will undergo a series of health and fitness drills. Successful training ends at some point in a colourful pass out ceremony.</p><p class=align-left>The location of your basic military training centre depends on some factors-the corps you join and the type of draftee. The Army Foundation College in Harrogate, Yorkshire serves as the primary training facility for regular soldiers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8aef8f704a06aea7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>KPA internship 2019: Minimum qualifications and the deadline for applying for the top fields</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Army officers withstand a 44-week long training session that culminates into a commissioning ceremony. The Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst accommodate candidate officers recruited in either January, May or September intake.</p><h2>Requirements for the British Army overseas recruitment</h2><p class=align-left>The requirement of new regular army personnel is subject to the Nationality Act 1981. This regulation demands that all potential candidates from Commonwealth nations have a 5-years of UK residence. Additionally, during the time of residence, you must not have moved out of the UK for a consecutive period of 180 days. Verification of a recruit’s UK Residency status and passport will be necessary.</p><p class=align-left>The 5-year mandatory is controversial in its own right. The UK government waived the requirement in 1998 but rescinded back to the earlier directive in 2013. The <a id=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-residency-rules-for-armed-forces-recruits href=# title="British army foreign recruitment British army overseas recruitment British army recruitment process" rel="nofollow noopener">review of UK residency rules</a> has been subject to change since then.</p><p class=align-left>Even more controversial is the claimed waiver of the required 5-years residency by the then Defence Minister Penny Mordaunt back in 2016. Although this order came fourth after consultation with the Home Office, it was seen as a remedy to address a <a href=# title="British army foreign recruitment British army overseas recruitment British army recruitment process" rel="nofollow noopener">shortfall </a>in the number of soldiers. Unfortunately, the British Army still upholds to the earlier decree.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/11b45581fbe61b53.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>DV lottery 2020 status check - process and results</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before you even think of applying to join the Queen’s Army make sure you check tick on all requisites.
