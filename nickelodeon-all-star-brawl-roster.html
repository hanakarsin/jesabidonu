According to Nyström, both teams collaborated closely to make sure that the wide array of colorful Nick characters were displayed prominently in the game.</p><p>"It was a joint effort between Ludosity and GameMill," Nyström told Game Informer. "We all pushed for our own favorites and wants until we got a lineup we could all get behind. From our side, we wanted fun characters from the shows that we liked, which is why we have some more unlikely picks like Nigel Thornberry."</p><p>Moving forward, the team also plans to stick closely to animated characters as opposed to bringing live-action shows into the mix.</p><p>"It fits in with the rest of the roster better, and we feel like we can go a little wilder in the moveset with [cartoon characters]."</p><p>No, we might not see the likes of Kenan Rockmore or Ned Bigby being added to the list, but the prospect of future DLC paves the way for plenty more animated favorites to join the brawl.</p><p>Does anyone have their fingers crossed for Jimmy Neutron?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7akt8Slpp2dn6N6orjLZqqtmaJir7Ot1qVkq6ejqbKz</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
