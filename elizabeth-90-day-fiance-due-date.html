Thanks to Tinder, the two connected and immediately hit it off. But the same can’t be said for Elizabeth’s siblings.</p><p>Elizabeth’s formerly tight-knit family was sent into turmoil when she and Andrei decided to tie the knot after only a year of dating. Despite their concerns, the couple is still going strong five years and one daughter later. In late March of 2022, Elizabeth announced that she was expecting baby number two.
