They asked us to come on Monday (today).</p><p>“Today, we‘re at DSS. They’re telling us the same thing. We DISAGREE.”</p><p>Also in a post on Facebook, Nnamdi Kanu’s brother, <strong>Emmanuel Prince</strong>, said he was denied access to the IPOB leader last Thursday and today, Monday.</p><p>He claimed that his brother was probably not in good shape, hence, DSS refusal to allow family and lawyers see him.</p><p>“I have been denied access to see Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (IPOB Leader) on two separate occasions at the Department of State Security Services Abuja</p><p>“It goes to show that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s life is in grave danger. It remains the order of the court that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (IPOB leader) must be seen twice weekly, Mondays and Thursday.</p><p>“Why can’t I see him? Has he been killed or poisoned? There must be proof of life. We demand proof of life”, he wrote.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Justice Binta Nyako</a></strong> of a Federal High Court in Abuja had ordered that Nnamdi Kanu be granted access to his lawyers and family twice a week – Mondays and Thursdays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FqZp%2BdkafAbq3SZpusq12owbC80majmq%2Bpmr%2B0ecWapKKkqWKzs7vMZqqenZmjtG66zZqknaFdoK6vwY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
