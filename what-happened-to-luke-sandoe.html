Many fans thought his death was caused by steroid abuse.</h2><p>It's no secret that the world of bodybuilding is one that's rife with health risks. Athletes put their joints, muscles, and organs under extreme duress. But there's another source of duress for bodybuilders that people don't talk about and that's the effect that steroid abuse has on one's system.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And this is what many fans thought was the cause of Luke Sandoe's death — that somehow steroid use resulted in health complications that resulted in his passing.</p><p>But this isn't the case.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Luke Sandoe's friend, Ben Chow, says the pro bodybuilder took his own life.</h2><p>Ben revealed that Luke's death was his own choice in an emotional Instagram video he uploaded to address the speculations surrounding the athlete's death:</p><p>"What happened with Luke was his choice, He decided that it was his only option and we’ll never comprehend what he was struggling with. I will say that in my time knowing Luke, he has battled with demons which dates back from long before bodybuilding and long before I met him."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I think that Luke's demons were bigger than ours," Chow said. He further explained that he felt conflicted about "outing" Luke's suicide, but believes that it's important to talk about mental health, especially when it comes to male athletes.</p><p>Seven-time 212 Mr. Olympia Flex Lewis also put up a tribute post in honor of Luke's memory.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I have tried to write something several times and can’t find the words to do it.<br>It feels like DejaVu two young men gone long before they should have.<br>I have known Luke for over a decade we were both sponsored by Gaspari, seen him win his pro card and watch his career grow into Signing with RedCon1, Podcasts, and on stage placing 3rd at the Arnold’s- Very proud. We got closer over the years, and not a week would go by without some s--t talk from him. Luke was a very funny guy and his humor I will miss. We rarely talked training, and i knew Luke was a deep guy but I never knew he was hurting.<br>Rest Well bro."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>When I first spoke with @lukesandoe I was impressed with his professionalism, sincerity, and his attitude. He didn’t tell me how great he was, or how huge a difference he was going to make for @redcon1 - instead he asked me to let him PROVE how valuable he would be. He wanted to show me that he could be of value before he asked me for anything significant. I always remember that first conversation and use it as an example of how to be. Prove your worth, THEN ask. Luke told me many times how he didn’t want to disappoint me, and how it was important to him that i felt like he did a good job. I never got a chance to tell him just how good a job he did. Everyone at the office, including me, loved Luke, and not only felt proud of him but we were proud to have him on the team. Please watch this video and honor Luke with remembering him fondly. I am a believer that you only truly die when no one remembers you, and speaks about you with kindness and revery. Luke’s legacy is even bigger than he was, and he will live on through us for generations. @redcon1 has decided to donate $25,000 to the children of @lukesandoe - please support the @fouadabiad @squatlikechow go fund me and help his family!
