Since the show debuted in 2019, viewers have seen the pairs do things like <a href=#>share bathwater</a>, wax one another, and wear matching outfits.</p><p><a href=#>Lauren Reese and her mother, Lisa Kimball,</a> may be new to the show for Season 3, but the two have already made quite the splash.</p><p>The two are so close that Lauren's wife, Laura Leigh Reese, has recognized that she's always going to be a second priority in comparison to Lisa. On the show, she's joked that she "married into a polygamous relationship" because Lisa is so involved in their union.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Though Laura Leigh and Lauren differ on how involved Lisa should be in their marriage, the spouses are trying to have a baby on Season 3. Lisa has taken her role as an overly involved mother to the next level, and she's aiding her daughter with at-home artificial insemination.</p><p>Viewers have yet to learn how it will all turn out for Laura Leigh and Lauren, so many have been wondering if the latter woman is pregnant.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lauren and Laura Leigh Reese want to become parents on Season 3 of 'sMothered.'</h2><p>The married pair wanted to have a baby long before the cameras started rolling for Season 3 of the TLC series. After about two years of trying various fertility treatments, Lauren decided to try an at-home version of artificial insemination.</p><p>Because Laura Leigh had wanted to take a break from the process due to the financial and emotional toll it was taking on the spouses, Lauren had to work with her mom in secret.</p><p>Shortly after their first stint with the at-home treatment was complete, Lauren wanted to take a pregnancy test. Before she could do so, Lauren decided to inform her wife about what had happened.</p><p>"We went ahead and did an at-home insemination," Lauren told her wife on the June 21 episode.</p><p>"You did what?" Laura Leigh responded. When Lauren said that it wasn't a big deal, Laura Leigh shared a different perspective.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"You went behind my back," Laura Leigh said. "And not only you went behind my back, you did it with your mom.... It hurts to not be part of something so big. How far is too far?"</p><p>While Lauren continued to try to diffuse the situation, Laura Leigh shared that she felt like a "third wheel" in her own marriage.</p><p>The episode concluded before Lauren had the chance to take a pregnancy test.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Lauren from 'sMothered' pregnant?</h2><p>The Louisiana native has not indicated that she is pregnant or that she had a baby on her public Instagram account. However, TLC reality stars generally stay mum about the outcome of their storylines until after their respective show airs.</p><p>Lauren has been sharing content on her page about her ongoing journey to get pregnant. Her last post about the matter was added in April of 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>There is also a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sMothered theory circulating online</a> that Lauren's co-star, Rykia Lewis, was her surrogate. Rykia has shared on Instagram that she chose to be a surrogate for a "very deserving family," but she has not disclosed any other details about the people she helped. Other than the fact that the two star on the same show together, there is no reason to believe that Rykia carried a baby for Lauren and Laura Leigh Reese.</p><p>sMothered airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuuMCuqZ6mXZu%2FsLmMrKSorJiav6awjKmpnp%2Belru1</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
