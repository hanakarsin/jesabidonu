I am informed by my staff and very reliable people that he was the object of that attack last night at about 10pm,” one of the top source said.</p><p>“The rest was just drama. My security staff told me the gunmen struck three days ago on the Oyo-Ogbomosho Road and around that time, their strange faces were also seen around an area the boys described to me.
