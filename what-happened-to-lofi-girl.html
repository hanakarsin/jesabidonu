LOFI GIRL HAS GONE MISSING. NO THIS IS NOT A DRILL.</p><p>Ok. Fine, we're being a little dramatic but if you know who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lofi Girl</a> is, then you know that she is always sitting near the window with her cat studying, and for her to not be there is a big deal.</p><p>But let us back up for a second, who is she? Lofi Girl is the name of a very popular <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel </a>with 12.1 million subscribers. The channel has a live stream that plays very soothing lofi hip-hop music that people "study-chill-sleep-repeat" to, as their bio reads. Lofi Girl is also a Japanese animated character who is always studying on the live stream with her cat.</p><p>So what happened to Lofi Girl? Let's investigate.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Lofi Girl?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/ @lowfigirl</a><p>LoFi Girl</p></figure><p>April 10, 2023, started as just a normal day, the way all days start with Lofi Girl. But when the clock struck 1 p.m EST, Lofi Girl, and her cat, seemingly vanished out of thin air. This was very distressing, for obvious reasons. But the thing is, there had been some clues...</p><p>On April Fools' Day, for example, Lofi Girl, for what seemed to be one of the first times ever, finally took a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">much-needed and deserved study break</a>. And while at the time we all chalked it up to being a very clever April Fools' joke, it laid the Easter egg that the powers that be over at Lofi girl can, and will, change it up</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span><p>What is happening with this blue window? ðŸ¤¨</p></figure><p>A couple days later on April 7, 2023, the Lofi Girl Youtube page posted a video titled, "What is happening with this blue window?" with the caption, "Wow! Have you seen this? Something is happening with this blue window now!"</p><p>Lofi Girl then commented on the video and pinned their comment saying that, "Soâ€¦ The blue window flashing appeared to be morse code redirecting to this strange website: <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lofiworld.com/.</a> Thanks for your help!"</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><p>Lofi Girl</p></figure><p>When you click the link, you are sent to a website. When you click "launch," you are redirected to the above YouTube video. The video is another live stream playing more ethereal music in what appears to be a bedroom of some sort. There a fishbowl, a guitar, a shelf with tchotchkes, and other miscellaneous items. Most notably however, is a countdown to April 11, 2023. April 11 is also circled on a calendar.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lofi Girl is obviously launching something...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This theory that Lofi Girl is planning something big is only further confirmed by a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> stating that Lofi Girl is:</p><p>"Preparing to drop a surprise that is set to take the music and streaming industry by storm... The interactive campaign, which kicks off on April 10th, promises to be a game-changer, building anticipation and excitement for the big reveal on April 11th.
