Throughout Season 17, the world has watched as Katie has had her fair share of romance in addition to a few heartbreaks.</p><p>In Episode 9, audiences witnessed Katie’s disappointment as she headed into her hometown dates with high hopes. The Bachelorette was left completed defeated and literally on the floor after a devastating breakup with Greg Grippo.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>He decided to leave the show after a somewhat rocky end to his hometown date.

It’s going to be a long final episode tonight, so fans be prepared.</p><p>The finale will run for two hours, and immediately after, the pre-taped "After the Final Rose" special will air hosted by Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe. With clips and photos being revealed from the post-finale episode, when was it actually filmed?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When was Katie Thurston's “After the Final Rose” filmed?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy</a>, a photo from the set of the "After the Finale Rose" special was posted on Twitter by comedian Gary Cannon on July 24 via Twitter. The photo was of Gary with hosts Tayshia and Kaitlyn and the Bachelorette Katie. In the leaked image, Katie is wearing a white dress and what appears to be an engagement ring on her ring finger. It seems, though, that Gary must have been contacted by production to delete the photo because it has since been removed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>However, a fan of the show saw it and posted it on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> discussion group for The Bachelor, where fans have been speculating what's to come. Although there has been no direct information from ABC about when the special was filmed, it's likely that, due to the timing of Greg's photo, the episode was most likely filmed on or slightly before July 24. One thing we do know, thanks to the podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Bait with Bachelor Nation,</a> the rumors about <a href=#>Greg's past</a> and actions will be scrutinized.</p><p>Kaitlyn told the podcast, "He just wanted to quit before he got fired. I think his ego was so hurt in that moment that he was like, 'I'm gonna just flip this s--t and get out of here." Of Greg's acting background, Tayshia noted, "That will be addressed. So just wait."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Katie Thurston (@thekatiethurston)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is "After the Final Rose" ever live?</h2><p>After the season finale of The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, the special “After the Finale Rose” would air live. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed that, and now the show is pre-taped to ensure proper safety and health precautions can be put into place. It will be nice to actually see an audience since the most recent The Bachelor season, Matt James' season, didn’t even have an audience because of COVID-19.</p><p>You can watch the Season 17 finale of The Bachelorette on ABC at 8 p.m. EST and "After the Finale Rose” will air right after at 10 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywmKxlm5bBqrGMmp2tnaJiwamxjJ%2Bgp5mcYr%2Bwv8RmnaKknZqx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
