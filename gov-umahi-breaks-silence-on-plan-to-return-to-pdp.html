Umahi is making contacts to return to PDP.</p><p>“Ordinarily, we wouldn’t have bothered responding to the publication, but we have freely elected to make a few clarifications to save the public, especially users of Social Media.</p><p>“First, I like to confirm that the statement is completely false, it is aimed at painting our Governor black and causing bad blood between him and the crew members of the next level train in Ebonyi State and Nigeria at large.</p><p>“It is worthy of note that the Governor made a landmark departure from the opposition political party out of personal conviction and freewill volition last year for the obvious irredeemable marginalization of Ndigbo.</p><p>“Let me state that the Governor has since moved on and has made the ruling APC his home, enjoying the full compliments of being a party at the centre, and does not need to even contemplate returning to PDP.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49sZqCnpmLCrq3HomSbqpWWuLR50qKjnqaTmnqwuoypo5qmXam8br7Erayrpl2pvG68w6lm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
