Accompanying the tweet was a photo of him and Ellen when he was a guest on her show.

It‚Äôs all for show," one former employee said, according to BuzzFeed News. "I know they give money to people and help them out, but it‚Äôs for show."</p><p>Days after that report, Ellen issued a public apology.</p><p>"On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that ‚ÄòThe Ellen DeGeneres Show‚Äô would be a place of happiness ‚Äî no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect," she wrote, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. "Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Several celebrities also spoke out saying they, too, believe Ellen isn't as kind as she makes herself seem, which is likely what prompted Jay Leno to issue his public support.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">However, given Jay Leno's racist joke on 'America's Got Talent,' people were quick to dismiss his support.</h2><p>While on set of America's Got Talent working as a guest judge, Jay Leno's racist joke sparked a workplace issue of its own.
