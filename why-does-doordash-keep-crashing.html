DoorDash customers across the nation, however, are currently in a hunger-induced outrage, due to apparently frequent outages on the company's website.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Distractify reached out to DoorDash for comment on the matter, but the delivery platform did not have a statement regarding the issue at this moment in time. Regardless, stay tuned for <a href=#>why the DoorDash app might be down</a> right now, and in the meantime, maybe try whipping up something on your own.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is DoorDash experiencing outages right now?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, DoorDash did not provide commentary on the current issue, however, we may have found the reason why the food delivery platform may be crashing for some people. According to a tweet from Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@GergelyOrosz</a>, a current engineer at Uber and a former employee at Skype, Microsoft, and Skyscanner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there was a Google Maps server-side update</a> that commenced on Friday, April 24. Unfortunately, it ended up affecting a number of mobile apps across the globe for several hours.</p><p>A few of the apps that were reportedly affected by the update in question included: Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, Seamless, Uber, Grab, Gojek, Lyft, Bolt, Bolt, Careem, Instacart, Groupon, TaskRabbit, Cornershop, WeatherBug, Strava, and Zillow. According to DownDetector, about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">79 percent of the outages were experienced on the app</a>, as opposed to only 15 percent on the website, and five percent login.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Holy moly yesterday a Google Maps backend update killed most mobile apps, worldwide for hours.</p><p>Here's what we know (thread):</p><p>üí•Most Android apps using Google Maps crashing<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Most iOS apps using Google Maps often crashing<br>üçîüöôüõí Most gig economy apps were unusable</p><p>(1/3)</p>‚Äî Gergely Orosz (@GergelyOrosz) <a href=#>April 24, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Apps impacted by crashing:<br>üçî Uber Eats, Doordash, Postmates, Grubhub, Seamless<br>üöôUber, Grab, Gojek, Lyft, Bolt, Bolt, Careem<br>üõí Instacart, Groupon, TaskRabbit, Cornershop<br>‚òÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüè†WeatherBug, Strava, Zillow<br>... and TONS more<a href=#>https://t.co/gFJTrWS9LH</a> (2/3)</p>‚Äî Gergely Orosz (@GergelyOrosz) <a href=#>April 24, 2020</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is there any way we can combat DoorDash's site issues?</h2><p>Normally, DoorDash recommends that customers try and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">troubleshoot the app</a> when it's being finicky, but since the company's website outages seem to be due to an external issue caused by a Google Maps update, the DoorDash app ‚Äî along with several other online delivery platforms ‚Äî&nbsp;might be out of order until further notice, when the Maps issue is completely resolved. Dang.</p><p>Since it seems as though the DoorDash website is giving users a little less trouble than the app, however, we recommend navigating to the DD website in your browser. Honestly, though, if that isn't working out for you, it seems like a good old-fashioned cooking session is in order for you later today, and we recommend referring to <a href=#>TikTok for some easy recipes</a>.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">See what fellow distressed DD customers are saying about the outages, below.</h2><p>Hopefully you'll find solace in seeing what other equally distressed DoorDash customers are saying regarding the food delivery website's outages ‚Äî you aren't alone on this one, trust us.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>While DoorDash is a staple among quarantine activities, the app could be down for the long run. We sincerely wish we could provide some more answers for you guys, but in the meantime, you should probably grab a snack.
