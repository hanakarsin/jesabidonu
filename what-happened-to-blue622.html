Blue622's job was listed as a network engineer, and as an entrepreneur for Twitch.</p><p>"Kenny was loved by all," one part of his obituary read. "He was known for his warm heart, caring nature, and abundant generosity. He was quick with a smile and always there with a helping hand. He was the person who opened his door and let friends sleep on the couch when they needed a place to stay. He was also a deep thinker who loved a conversation, always with fact and logic, with love and compassion."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Two days before his own death, Blue622 mourned the passing of streamer Reckful (real name Byron Bernstein), who died by suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>"Just heard the news about Reckful... &nbsp;He was an amazing person with a huge heart and will be missed.

"He's the reason a lot of people have their jobs today... he's just a nice guy, man."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was his cause of death?</h2><p>There was no announcement about what Kenny died from, and his passing was only referred to as "unexpected" in his obituary. Drama Alert creator Keemstar said that Blue622 died as a result of an "apparent suicide," but that has not been confirmed by his loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In March of 2020, Kenny issued an apology to his followers on Twitter and the NoPixel community about prioritizing socializing over his livestreaming. He discussed his subsequent financial hardships as well, and how he was temporarily banned from gaming.</p><p>"First I want to start with an apology to my community and the NoPixel family. I was out of line and deserved my punishment. I will reach out to those directly affected by childish actions if possible. I take full responsibility for what happened and it was nobody's fault but my own. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Another twitch streamer passed away due to apparent suicide.</p><p>If you are reading this and you are having suicidal thoughts you are not alone. 2020 is a very hard year for many.</p><p>But life always gets better.

Once the server blew up I was able to make it a full time job with the money from donos and twitch. At this point I was staying rent free with a family member so I was able to live off the income. I figured as long as I keep this up I'll do what I love for a job," Blue622 continued.&nbsp;</p><p>"Once I had to get my own apartment again things changed drastically. Friends would come over to party and I put streaming second," he wrote. "I would stream when everyone left and let's just say I had the wrong mindset after partying all day."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Things got real when I noticed most months I didn't have the money to pay rent or bills most the time, but I did nothing to change it. So I would make donation goals just to scrape by. I never wanted the stream or community to feel obligated to pay to watch me stream. This changed how I approached streaming and honestly it made me depressed and self medicate with booze and drugs. If you followed me for a while you know what I mean," he explained.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"As I say this I want to be clear I don't want any sympathy it was my actions that caused this. I got what I deserved. The status update of my life is I'm being evicted from my apartment and they turned off my internet and cable and will be out anyday [sic]. I didn't go like crazy and disappear after the drunk stream," he stated. "I have no idea when I'll be able to get back on NoPixel or if I'm even welcome back even when I get my internet back and stable living situation, but I'm working on it."</p><p>"I took my dream job for granted and regret it every day," he said. "Again I'm sorry for that last day and ruining others' roleplay."&nbsp;</p><p>Blue622 then discussed how he had also lost his car, and that the situation made him more appreciative for what he had before.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It's tough being this honest with everyone, but I get messages daily from supporters asking where the f--k I've been and the least I can do is be honest," he wrote. "Once I stopped being a dumb--s and partying daily I realized what I done [sic]. I don't deserve your forgiveness, just wanted to explain for those who care. I wish I could do it all again but this time treat it as the job it should be, but I can't."&nbsp;</p><p>Blue622 then said that he wasn't asking for forgiveness, but that he loved his fans. Our thoughts are with his loved ones, fans, and fellow Twitch streamers at this time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSbpKWag3N%2B</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
