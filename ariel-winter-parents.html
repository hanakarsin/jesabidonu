The show centers around the wacky antics of three families living in a wealthy Los Angeles suburb.</p><p>Ariel opened up about playing the beloved role in a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a>. “There are families that have talked to us about how Modern Family has impacted them and how we’ve normalized so many things and impacted so many young people,” Ariel said. She went on to call the show an “amazing experience,” and gushed over her time with her castmates.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Ariel Winter attends the 21st Annual Warner Bros.

Here’s a breakdown of what led to Ariel legally distancing herself from her parents.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ariel Winter became an emancipated minor at 17.</h2><p>In 2015, Ariel became an emancipated minor after being involved in a lengthy guardianship battle against her mother, Chrisoula Workman. Per court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Chrisoula was “a terror” on the set of Modern Family, which jeopardized Ariel’s future on the hit sitcom. Furthermore, Ariel’s attorney argued that Chrisoula was emotionally and physically abusive to the young star and deprived her of food during the tapings of the show.</p><p>Chrisoula denied the allegations, suggesting instead that Ariel fabricated the story of abuse after she was caught in bed with a boy four years her senior. A judge later ruled in Ariel’s favor and the Modern Family star celebrated by thanking her supporters in a message posted to Twitter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am now officially emancipated!!!

Ariel went on to reveal that her sister, Shanelle Gray, has served as her legal guardian since she was 14 due to an undisclosed incident that occurred with Chrisoula.</p><p>She added, “The reason I don't really share that is because I want to give her the respect that she didn't give to me publicly.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Ariel Winter and sister Shanelle Workman arrive at the Premiere of "Mr. Peabody & Sherman" March 5, 2014</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ariel joins a list of other emancipated celebrity children.</h2><p>Of course, Ariel is not the first young celebrity to seek emancipation from their parents.
