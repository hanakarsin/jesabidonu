He was originally a close ally to Tobias Whale (Marvin "Krondon" Jones III), until he realized how much of a supervillain Tobias was.</p><p>The seventh episode of Season 4, which was simply entitled "Painkiller," served as a pilot episode to introduce a series all about the track-star-turned-hero.</p><p>On May 24, just hours before the series finale aired, Jordan Calloway confirmed that The CW did not pick up Painkiller.</p><p>"For those of you who have not heard, Painkiller will not be going any further. So, let's rip that Band-Aid off now, OK?" the actor shared in an Instagram video. "Now, what I wanted to do was, just very quickly, make a video saying 'thank you.' Thank you to the fans, thank you to the supporters, thank you to [The] CW, to Warner Media for affording me the opportunity to even do a spin-off. Also, thank you, most importantly, to my cast, my crew, and to my guy, [Painkiller]."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jordan Calloway (@j_calloway6)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jordan then noted that he was officially saying goodbye to the Painkiller character.</p><p>"Doing this project has been nothing less than a blessing. I can't put into words how grateful I am," Jordan added. "From the experiences I've learned, to the relationships [that] I've made, it has been a blast. It has been phenomenal. As we lay this character to rest, we move on to the next chapter, I wanted to say thank you..."</p><p>Neither the actor nor the network shared exactly why Painkiller was axed. Black Lightning consistently had low ratings by The CW standards throughout its run, and viewership continued to decline throughout the final season. It can, therefore, be expected that the backdoor pilot episode didn't get the buzz that was needed in order for it to move forward.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The CW has greenlit more superhero shows — including an origin story for Naomi from the DC Comics.</h2><p>Black Lightning fans may not be happy with the latest Painkiller update, but The CW is still focused on delivering superhero content. Superman & Lois was renewed for a second season shortly after the first episode aired in 2021s. A new series, Wonder Girl, is slated to premiere once Supergirl comes to an end.</p><p>Before the Season 4 finale of Black Lightning aired, The CW confirmed that Naomi had also officially been picked up for a season order.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The origin story of a new hero.
