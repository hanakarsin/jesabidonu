The presidency initially said he had a “persistent ear infection”.</p><p class=align-left>But his prolonged absence during one of the medical trips, coupled with lack of information about the exact nature of his illness led to speculations that his condition was more serious and might affect his ability to govern the most populous country in Africa.</p><p class=align-left>About a month after the president eventually returned from London from another lengthy medical trip, speculations started filtering out about his identity.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 2019: INEC raises alarm, says parties nominate underage for presidential election</p><p class=align-left>According to AFP, the earliest online mention of the claim was in a video posted by Twitter user @sam_ezeh on September 3, 2017.
