The source said, “Late on Friday night, the gunmen infiltrated the community and targeted the Pastor, mercilessly shooting him before abducting his wife and vanishing without a trace.”</p><p>Furthermore, the source elaborated that approximately three months ago, the same group of gunmen had made an unsuccessful attempt to kidnap the clergyman’s son. However, with the assistance of the community, their nefarious plan was thwarted, although the Pastor’s son sustained injuries during the incident.</p><p>The individual clarified that the assailants had made a phone call earlier on Saturday morning, demanding a ransom of N3 million from the family. However, no further communication has been received from them since then.</p><p>He expressed that there has been a prevailing sense of unease within the community following the occurrence of the incident. He appealed to both security agencies and the government to assist in rescuing the traumatized widow.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the state police command has not issued any official statement yet about the incident as of the time of filing this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5ByZqCtnqKyr3nKoqOlZaCWwLW70Waiopyelr1uw8ifnGahnmK4orDUp5hmm5%2Biura6yK2waA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
